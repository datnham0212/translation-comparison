1
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:18,057
Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,939
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,947
I could eat about a million
and a half of these.

4
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,948
My mama always said

5
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:38,747
life was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,949
You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:53,300
Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:56,735
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,739
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:04,412
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,913
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,916
Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:12,920
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,922
Where they're going,

15
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,457
where they've been.

16
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,058
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,938
I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,440
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:39,280
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

20
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,439
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

21
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,952
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

22
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,323
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,561
How do those feel?

24
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,272
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,777
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,906
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,350
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,682
Forrest!

29
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,416
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

30
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,254
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero</i>

31
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,420
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

32
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,931
<i>She said we was related
to him in some way.</i>

33
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,432
<i>What he did was,</i>

34
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,936
<i>he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

35
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,440
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets</i>

36
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,944
<i>and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>

37
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,948
<i>They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

38
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,077
<i>And, anyway, that's how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.</i>

39
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,486
<i>Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me</i>

40
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,492
<i>that sometimes we all
do things that, well,</i>

41
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,994
<i>that just don't make no sense.</i>

42
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,939
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

43
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,168
All right.

44
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,177
What are y'all staring at?

45
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,678
Haven't you ever seen

46
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,738
a little boy with braces
on his legs before?

47
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,417
Don't ever let anybody

48
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,919
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

49
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,422
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

50
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,425
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

51
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,429
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,965
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,970
<i>about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,973
<i>That's in the county
of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,475
<i>Our house had been
in Mama's family</i>

56
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,602
<i>since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa</i>

57
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,115
<i>had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.</i>

58
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,548
<i>Since it was just me and Mama</i>

59
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,552
<i>and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

60
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,054
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

61
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,556
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

62
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

63
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,230
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

64
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,062
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

65
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,068
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

66
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,162
You're no different
than anybody else is.

67
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,908
Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?

68
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,411
You're the same
as everybody else.

69
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,413
You are no different.

70
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:33,145
Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,653
His I.Q. Is 75.

72
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,247
Well, we're all different,

73
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,587
Mr. Hancock.

74
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,263
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education</i>

75
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,768
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

76
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,770
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

77
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,103
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

78
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,575
Now, this is normal.

79
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:02,638
Forrest is right here.

80
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,549
The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80

81
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,347
to attend public school.

82
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,717
Mrs. Gump,

83
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,689
he's going to have to
go to a special school.

84
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,192
Now, he'll be just fine.

85
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,694
What does normal mean anyway?

86
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,697
He might be...

87
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,892
a bit on the slow side,

88
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,400
but my boy Forrest

89
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,404
is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

90
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,565
He's not going to
some special school

91
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,574
to learn how to retread tires.

92
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,634
We're talking about
five little points here.

93
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,382
There must be something
can be done.

94
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,910
We're a progressive
school system.

95
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,752
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

96
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,591
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

97
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
He's on vacation.

98
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:59,936
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!

99
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:04,632
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

100
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,385
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

101
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:16,886
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

102
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,586
You don't say much, do you?

103
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:31,800
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

104
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,905
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

105
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:37,233
"Finally, he had to try.

106
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:40,242
"It looked easy, but...

107
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,904
oh, what happened.
First they..."

108
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:46,244
Mama, what's vacation mean?

109
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:47,578
Vacation?

110
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,414
Where Daddy went?

111
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,085
Vacation's when
you go somewhere...

112
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,757
and you don't ever come back.

113
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,766
<i>Anyway, I guess you could say</i>

114
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,394
<i>me and Mama was on our own.</i>

115
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,438
<i>But we didn't mind.</i>

116
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,940
<i>Our house was never empty.</i>

117
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:14,943
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

118
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,103
Supper!

119
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,612
It's supper, everyone!

120
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,205
That sure looks special.

121
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:22,115
<i>Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us</i>

122
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:25,621
<i>that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,</i>

123
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:28,123
<i>folks living
out of their suitcases</i>

124
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,627
<i>and hat cases
and sample cases.</i>

125
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:35,392
Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

126
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:38,298
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

127
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:41,462
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

128
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,808
~ Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit ~

129
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,471
~ And you ain't no ~

130
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:53,072
~ Friend of mine ~

131
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,543
Forrest,

132
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,383
I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

133
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,889
No, that's all right, ma'am.

134
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:04,393
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

135
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:07,396
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

136
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:10,399
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

137
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,903
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.

138
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,403
Slow it down some.

139
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:17,940
~ You ain't nothing but... ~

140
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:20,306
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

141
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,971
<i>It sounded good.</i>

142
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:28,279
<i>I started moving around
to the music,</i>

143
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,285
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

144
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,446
~ Cryin' all the time ~

145
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:34,012
<i>This one night,</i>

146
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,024
<i>me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

147
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,526
<i>and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,</i>

148
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,584
<i>and guess what?</i>

149
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:46,068
<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>

150
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:49,196
<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>

151
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,841
<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>

152
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,810
This is not for
children's eyes.

153
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,938
<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>

154
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,447
<i>Some years later,</i>

155
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,451
<i>that handsome young man
who they called the King,</i>

156
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,420
<i>well, he sung too many songs.</i>

157
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,423
<i>Had himself a heart attack
or something.</i>

158
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,483
It must be hard being a king.

159
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:17,432
You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,

160
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,432
but some things you can't.

161
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:21,968
You do your very best now, Forrest.

162
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:24,438
I sure will, Mama.

163
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:28,034
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school</i>

164
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,442
<i>very well.</i>

165
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:34,380
Are you coming along?

166
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,943
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.

167
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,546
This is the bus to school.

168
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:45,824
I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.

169
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,692
I'm Dorothy Harris.

170
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:50,198
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.

171
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:05,642
This seat's taken.

172
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,514
It's taken.

173
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,517
You can't sit here.

174
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:24,767
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

175
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:27,166
<i>'cause I don't
remember being born.</i>

176
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:30,638
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

177
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:32,140
and I don't know

178
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,642
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

179
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,144
but I do remember

180
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:40,205
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

181
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,183
<i>in the wide world.</i>

182
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:45,187
You can sit here
if you want.

183
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:51,392
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

184
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,055
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

185
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,896
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

186
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,030
What's wrong with your legs?

187
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,041
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

188
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,907
My legs are just fine and dandy.

189
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,913
<i>I just sat next to her
on that bus</i>

190
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,916
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

191
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,418
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

192
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:20,115
<i>Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me</i>

193
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,590
<i>or asked me questions.</i>

194
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,923
Are you stupid or something?

195
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:28,054
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

196
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,123
I'm Jenny.

197
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,761
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

198
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,270
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

199
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,899
<i>Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.</i>

200
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,911
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

201
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,471
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

202
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,211
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

203
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,809
"A good little..."

204
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,321
<i>She helped me
learn how to read,</i>

205
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:56,483
<i>and I showed her how to swing.</i>

206
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:00,061
<i>Sometimes, we'd just sit out</i>

207
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,427
<i>and wait for the stars.</i>

208
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:04,966
Mama's going to worry about me.

209
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,935
Just stay a little longer.

210
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:12,100
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

211
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:14,939
O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.

212
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:19,311
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

213
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:23,280
My only friend.

214
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,956
Now, my mama always told me

215
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,958
that miracles happen every day.

216
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:31,960
Some people don't think so,

217
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,518
but they do.

218
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:37,891
Hey, dummy!

219
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,436
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

220
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,267
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

221
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:44,670
Just run away, Forrest.

222
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,107
Run, Forrest!

223
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:49,269
Run away! Hurry!

224
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,903
Get the bikes!

225
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,777
Let's get him! Come on!

226
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,646
Look out, Gump!

227
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:57,584
We're going to get you!

228
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,781
Run, Forrest, run!

229
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,881
Run, Forrest!

230
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:04,817
Come back here, you!

231
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,092
Ha ha ha ha ha!

232
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,407
Run, Forrest!

233
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:23,069
Run!

234
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,273
<i>Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...</i>

235
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,578
but I could run
like the wind blows.

236
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,909
From that day on,

237
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:07,421
if I was going somewhere,

238
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,856
I was running.

239
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:46,061
That boy sure
is a running fool.

240
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,964
<i>Now, remember how I told you</i>

241
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,967
<i>that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>

242
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:57,402
<i>She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

243
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:00,100
<i>Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,</i>

244
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:04,612
<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>

245
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,907
Jenny?

246
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,915
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

247
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:13,147
<i>He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.</i>

248
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,923
<i>And then this one time,</i>

249
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,926
<i>Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.</i>

250
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:22,428
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

251
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:24,931
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

252
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,091
Jenny!

253
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,431
Come on!

254
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:31,438
Jenny, where'd you run to?

255
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,031
You better
get back here, girl!

256
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,175
Where you at?

257
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:42,949
Jenny!

258
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,882
Jenny, where you at?

259
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,656
Jenny!

260
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,657
Pray with me, Forrest.

261
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,158
Pray with me.

262
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:53,455
Jenny!

263
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,827
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

264
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,832
far, far away from here.

265
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,837
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

266
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:06,840
<i>Mama always said
God is mysterious.</i>

267
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:08,239
Jenny!

268
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,244
<i>He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.</i>

269
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,075
<i>Instead,</i>

270
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,082
<i>he had the police say</i>

271
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,586
<i>Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.</i>

272
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,087
<i>She was to live
with her grandma,</i>

273
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:23,090
<i>just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

274
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:27,151
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

275
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,622
<i>Some nights,</i>

276
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,631
<i>Jenny'd sneak out</i>

277
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,133
<i>and come on over to my house,</i>

278
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,636
<i>just 'cause
she said she was scared.</i>

279
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,696
<i>Scared of what,
I don't know.</i>

280
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:42,436
<i>But I think
it was her grandma's dog.</i>

281
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,445
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

282
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:48,676
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends</i>

283
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,240
<i>all the way up
through high school.</i>

284
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:52,685
Hey, stupid!

285
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,722
Quit it!

286
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,222
Run, Forrest, run!

287
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,690
Hey,

288
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,784
didn't you hear me, stupid?

289
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:00,793
Run, Forrest!

290
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,193
Get in the truck!

291
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:05,596
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

292
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,135
Run, Forrest! Run!

293
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:12,835
Ha, ha!

294
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,102
Move it! Move it!

295
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:17,007
You better be runnin'!

296
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,489
Yeah!

297
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,220
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!

298
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,321
Run, Forrest!

299
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,992
Now, it used to be

300
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,005
I ran to get
where I was going.

301
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:48,406
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

302
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,366
Ohh!

303
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:19,097
Who in the hell is that?

304
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:21,971
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

305
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,034
Just a local idiot.

306
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:26,478
<i>And can you believe it?</i>

307
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:29,345
<i>I got to go to college, too.</i>

308
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,489
Forrest, move it!

309
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,489
Run!

310
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:38,490
O.K.!

311
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,651
Run!

312
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:42,560
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

313
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,311
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

314
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,211
Run! Run! Go!

315
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:18,031
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

316
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,067
but he sure is fast.

317
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,902
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,</i>

318
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:28,032
<i>but college was
very confusing times.</i>

319
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:31,709
<i>Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,</i>

320
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,043
<i>integrated the University
of Alabama today.</i>

321
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:35,639
<i>Two Negroes were admitted,</i>

322
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:37,651
<i>but only after
Governor George Wallace</i>

323
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,653
<i>had carried out
his symbolic threat</i>

324
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:42,155
<i>to stand in the schoolhouse door.</i>

325
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:44,987
I take it from that statement...

326
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,993
Earl, what's going on?

327
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,495
Coons are trying
to get into school.

328
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:52,499
Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,

329
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,001
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

330
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,934
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

331
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:59,939
And they want to go
to school with us.

332
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,941
With us? They do?

333
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,943
<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace</i>

334
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:06,946
<i>had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,</i>

335
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:10,074
<i>Kennedy ordered the secretary
of defense to use military force.</i>

336
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:12,483
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter</i>

337
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,987
<i>by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,</i>

338
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,614
<i>and Governor Wallace.</i>

339
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,455
<i>Because these National Guardsmen</i>

340
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:22,963
<i>are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,</i>

341
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,964
<i>and they live within our borders.</i>

342
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,966
<i>They are our brothers.</i>

343
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,628
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

344
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:32,639
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

345
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:36,643
<i>to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times</i>

346
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:38,645
<i>that is so evident today...</i>

347
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:42,513
<i>A trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.</i>

348
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,487
<i>And so, at day's end,</i>

349
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:51,013
<i>the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,</i>

350
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:53,617
<i>and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone</i>

351
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:57,562
<i>had been signed up
for summer classes.</i>

352
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,129
Ma'am, you dropped your book.

353
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:02,794
Ma'am.

354
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,304
<i>Governor Wallace
did what he promised.</i>

355
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:08,968
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...</i>

356
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:10,510
Say, wasn't that Gump?

357
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:12,603
Naw, that couldn't be.

358
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,615
It sure as hell was.

359
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,988
<i>A few years later,</i>

360
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:23,489
<i>that angry little man
at the schoolhouse door</i>

361
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,584
<i>thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for president.</i>

362
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,693
<i>But somebody thought
that it wasn't.</i>

363
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,361
But he didn't die.

364
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,475
My bus is here.

365
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,477
Is it the number 9?

366
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,479
No, it's the number 4.

367
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:49,072
It was nice talking to you.

368
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,983
I remember when that happened,

369
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,488
when Wallace got shot.

370
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:56,921
I was in college.

371
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:59,425
Did you go to a girls' college

372
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:01,860
or a girls' and boys'
together college?

373
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:03,123
It was coed.

374
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,927
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

375
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,093
It was a college
just for girls.

376
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,605
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

377
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:20,442
<i>~ I don't know why I love you ~</i>

378
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:24,005
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

379
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:29,845
<i>~ I don't know why I cry so ~</i>

380
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:32,390
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

381
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:39,928
<i>~ I only know I know that... ~</i>

382
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,933
Ohh!

383
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,434
That hurts.

384
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:48,463
<i>~ But I don't know why
I love you ~</i>

385
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,533
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

386
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:58,413
Forrest!

387
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,418
Forrest, stop it!

388
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:01,919
Stop it!

389
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:03,421
What are you doing?

390
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:04,922
He was hurting you.

391
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:06,424
No, he wasn't!

392
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:08,426
Get over there!

393
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:09,927
Billy, I'm sorry.

394
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,429
Just keep away from me.

395
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,431
Don't be such... Don't go.

396
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,433
Billy, wait a second.

397
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,867
He doesn't know any better.

398
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:22,531
Forrest, why'd you do that?

399
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:28,447
I brought you some chocolate.

400
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:29,742
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,952
I'll go back
to my college now.

402
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:36,283
Forrest...

403
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:41,049
Look at you.

404
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,622
Come on.

405
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,238
Is this your own room?

406
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:55,239
Shh!

407
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,147
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

408
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,649
about who you're going to be?

409
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,318
Who I'm going to be?

410
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:08,318
Yeah.

411
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,321
Aren't I going to be me?

412
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:11,651
You'll always be you,

413
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:13,658
just another kind of you.

414
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,819
You know?

415
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,829
I want to be famous.

416
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:22,659
I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.

417
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:24,669
I just want to be...

418
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:26,170
on an empty stage

419
00:27:26,238 --> 00:27:28,832
with my guitar, my voice.

420
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:31,501
Just me.

421
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:36,681
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

422
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,518
I want to be able
to say things,

423
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,020
just one to one.

424
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,454
Have you ever been
with a girl, Forrest?

425
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,799
I sit next to them

426
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,359
in my home economics class
all the time.

427
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:26,056
Oh...

428
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,561
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:29,658
It's O.K.

430
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:30,667
Sorry.

431
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:34,167
Oh...

432
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:37,842
Oh...

433
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,400
It's all right.

434
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:44,081
It's O.K.

435
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,582
Oh, I'm dizzy.

436
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:56,859
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

437
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,533
No.

438
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:11,674
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

439
00:29:11,743 --> 00:29:14,177
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

440
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:20,516
Run! Run! Run! Run!

441
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:22,553
Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

442
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,555
Stop! Stop! Stop!

443
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,695
<i>College ran by real fast</i>

444
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:34,933
<i>'cause I played
so much football.</i>

445
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,192
<i>They even put me on a thing</i>

446
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,700
<i>called the all-America team</i>

447
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,532
<i>where you get to meet</i>

448
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,538
<i>the president of the United States.</i>

449
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:42,868
President Kennedy met

450
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:45,102
with the collegiate
all-American football team

451
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:46,610
at the Oval Office today.

452
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,438
<i>Now the really good thing</i>

453
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:51,446
<i>about meeting the president
of the United States</i>

454
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:52,947
<i>is the food.</i>

455
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,280
<i>They put you in this little room</i>

456
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:58,947
<i>with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

457
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,614
<i>But since, number one,</i>

458
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,282
<i>I wasn't hungry but thirsty,</i>

459
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,953
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

460
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:08,794
<i>I must have drank me
about 15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

461
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:13,928
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

462
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:15,266
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

463
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:17,932
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

464
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,976
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

465
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:22,637
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

466
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,145
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

467
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:26,148
<i>Congratulations.
How do you feel?</i>

468
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:28,650
<i>I got to pee.</i>

469
00:30:28,718 --> 00:30:31,243
<i>I believe he said
he had to pee.</i>

470
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:48,599
<i>Some time later,
for no particular reason,</i>

471
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,971
<i>somebody shot
that nice young president</i>

472
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,442
<i>when he was riding
in his car.</i>

473
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,376
<i>And a few years after that,</i>

474
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,880
<i>somebody shot
his little brother, too,</i>

475
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:01,280
<i>only he was
in a hotel kitchen.</i>

476
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,612
Must be hard being brothers.

477
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:07,520
I wouldn't know.

478
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:08,986
Forrest Gump.

479
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,492
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

480
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,994
<i>After only five years
of playing football,</i>

481
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,655
<i>I got a college degree.</i>

482
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:17,325
Congratulations, son.

483
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,527
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

484
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,034
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

485
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:24,698
I'll hold this for you.

486
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:26,867
Congratulations, son.

487
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:29,537
Have you given any thought
to your future?

488
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:33,081
Thought?

489
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:36,251
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

490
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,911
Nobody gives a horse's shit

491
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:39,579
who you are, pus ball!

492
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:42,420
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

493
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,756
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

494
00:31:44,828 --> 00:31:46,261
You're in the army now!

495
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,092
Seat's taken.

496
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,425
Taken.

497
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:57,405
<i>At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.</i>

498
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:59,408
<i>It was only
my induction day,</i>

499
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:01,535
<i>and I was getting yelled at.</i>

500
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,709
Sit down if you want to.

501
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:10,048
<i>I didn't know who I might meet</i>

502
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,553
<i>or what they might ask.</i>

503
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:14,385
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

504
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:16,220
No.

505
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:19,056
But I been on a real big boat.

506
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:22,064
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

507
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:25,067
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.

508
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:27,399
I started out
on my uncle's boat

509
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,404
when I was about maybe 9.

510
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,407
I was just looking
into buying my own boat

511
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:34,409
and got drafted.

512
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:37,742
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

513
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:40,078
People call me Bubba,

514
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,584
just like one of them
old redneck boys.

515
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,914
Can you believe that?

516
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:46,080
My name's Forrest Gump.

517
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,420
People call me Forrest Gump.

518
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:51,426
<i>So Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

519
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,223
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp.</i>

520
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:57,564
<i>And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,</i>

521
00:32:57,634 --> 00:33:01,229
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

522
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:03,067
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

523
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,573
<i>there was to know about
the shrimping business.</i>

524
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,906
I know everything
there is to know

525
00:33:07,977 --> 00:33:09,239
about the shrimping business.

526
00:33:09,312 --> 00:33:11,746
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

527
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,079
after I get out of the army.

528
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:17,975
O.K.

529
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,316
Gump!

530
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,983
What's your sole purpose
in this army?

531
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:24,492
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

532
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:28,156
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

533
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:30,665
That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.

534
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:33,327
You must have
a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.

535
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:35,997
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

536
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,504
Listen up, people!

537
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:42,511
<i>Now for some reason,
I fit in the army</i>

538
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:44,513
<i>like one of them round pegs.</i>

539
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,843
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

540
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:47,849
<i>You just make your bed neat,</i>

541
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,350
<i>remember to stand up straight,</i>

542
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,011
<i>and always answer every question</i>

543
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:53,021
<i>with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."</i>

544
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:54,522
Is that clear?

545
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,855
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

546
00:33:56,926 --> 00:34:00,362
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

547
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,692
On a good day,

548
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:04,699
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

549
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,029
Everything goes all right,

550
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:07,865
2 men shrimping 10 hours,

551
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,030
less what you spends on gas...

552
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:12,199
Done, Drill Sergeant!

553
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,708
Gump!

554
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:18,213
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

555
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:20,215
You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.

556
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:21,875
Jesus H. Christ.

557
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,885
This is a new company record.

558
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,386
If it wasn't a waste

559
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:26,888
of a fine enlisted man,

560
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:29,390
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

561
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:31,723
You're going to be
a general someday!

562
00:34:31,794 --> 00:34:33,728
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

563
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,732
Anyway, like I was saying,

564
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,064
shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.

565
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:43,401
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

566
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:44,906
bake it, sauté it.

567
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:48,068
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

568
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:52,080
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

569
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:53,410
stir fried.

570
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,246
There's pineapple shrimp

571
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:58,185
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

572
00:34:58,254 --> 00:34:59,380
pepper shrimp,

573
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:01,889
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

574
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,550
shrimp salad,

575
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,389
shrimp in potatoes,

576
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,894
shrimp burger,

577
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:08,726
shrimp sandwich.

578
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,060
That... That's about it.

579
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:20,470
<i>Nighttime in the army
is a lonely time.</i>

580
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:22,977
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks,</i>

581
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:25,480
<i>and I'd miss my mama,</i>

582
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:28,142
<i>and I'd miss Jenny.</i>

583
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,488
Hey, Gump.

584
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:36,150
Get a load of the tits on her.

585
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,338
<i>Turns out...</i>

586
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,499
<i>Jenny had gotten
into some trouble</i>

587
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:55,840
<i>over some photos of her
in her college sweater.</i>

588
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:58,107
<i>And she was
thrown out of school.</i>

589
00:35:58,181 --> 00:36:01,344
~ My baby does the hanky panky ~

590
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,851
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

591
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,354
<i>'cause a man who owns a theater</i>

592
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:07,855
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

593
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:09,516
<i>saw those photos</i>

594
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:13,358
<i>and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

595
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:15,522
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

596
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:17,862
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis</i>

597
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,198
<i>to see her perform in that show.</i>

598
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:21,702
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

599
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,204
Give her a big hand.

600
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:26,207
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

601
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,038
direct from Hollywood,
California,

602
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,874
our very own beatnik beauty.

603
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,210
Let's give a big round of applause

604
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,044
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

605
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:49,060
~ How many roads
must a man walk down ~

606
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:54,502
~ Before you can
call him a man? ~

607
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,770
~ Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail ~

608
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,777
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

609
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,779
~ Before she sleeps
in the sand? ~

610
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,678
<i>She was a folksinger.</i>

611
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,843
~ Yes, and how many times ~

612
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:12,979
~ Must the cannonballs fly ~

613
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:17,652
~ Before they're
forever banned? ~

614
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:19,058
Shake it up now.

615
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:20,561
Somebody get her a harmonica.

616
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,359
~ The answer, my friend ~

617
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:24,195
~ Is blowin' in the wind ~

618
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,700
<i>This ain't Captain Kangaroo.</i>

619
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:28,532
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

620
00:37:28,604 --> 00:37:30,663
Hey! God damn it!

621
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,004
Hey, you stupid jerk!

622
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:34,839
I'm singing a song here.

623
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,347
Polly, get out here!

624
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:41,849
Shut up yourself!

625
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:43,385
Just shut up!

626
00:37:45,955 --> 00:37:48,890
Forrest! What are you
doing here?

627
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,289
What are you doing?

628
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:51,291
- Hey!
- Aw!

629
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,123
What are you doing, Forrest?

630
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,221
Let me down!

631
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:57,823
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!

632
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,302
Ha ha ha!

633
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:01,869
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

634
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:04,371
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

635
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,237
They was trying to grab you.

636
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:08,641
A lot of people try to grab me.

637
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:12,704
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

638
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:16,309
I can't help it.
I love you.

639
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:18,649
Forrest...

640
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:20,689
You don't know what love is.

641
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,365
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

642
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:35,203
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

643
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,205
so I could fly far away.

644
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,033
Yes, I do.

645
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:45,446
You think I could
fly off this bridge?

646
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:55,714
What do you mean, Jenny?

647
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,156
Nothing.

648
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,496
I got to get out of here.

649
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:08,829
Wait, Jenny.

650
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:11,338
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O.K.?

651
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:13,341
You stay away from me, please.

652
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:14,842
Can I have a ride?

653
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,172
Where are you going?

654
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:17,337
I don't care.

655
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:18,641
Get in the truck.

656
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,909
So bye-bye, Jenny.

657
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,185
They sending me to Vietnam.

658
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,722
It's this whole other country.

659
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:34,057
Just hang on a minute.

660
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:38,566
Listen, you promise me
something, O.K.?

661
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:40,568
Just if you're
ever in trouble,

662
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:41,898
don't be brave.

663
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:44,906
You just run, O.K.?
Just run away.

664
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,339
O.K.

665
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,843
Jenny.

666
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,511
I'll write you all the time.

667
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:09,693
<i>And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

668
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:27,381
You come back safe to me.

669
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:28,882
Do you hear?

670
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,062
~ Some folks are born ~

671
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:52,402
~ Made to wave the flag ~

672
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:55,739
~ Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue ~

673
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:59,338
~ And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" ~

674
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:03,009
~ Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you ~

675
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,854
~ It ain't me ~

676
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:10,016
~ I ain't no senator's son ~

677
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,855
~ It ain't me ~

678
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,360
<i>Now they told us</i>

679
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:16,363
<i>that Vietnam was going
to be very different</i>

680
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,456
<i>from the United States
of America.</i>

681
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:22,629
<i>Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,</i>

682
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:24,467
<i>it was.</i>

683
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:37,310
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

684
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:40,321
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

685
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:42,323
After we win this war

686
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:44,018
and we take over everything,

687
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:46,356
we can get American
shrimpers out here

688
00:41:46,428 --> 00:41:47,690
and shrimp these waters.

689
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,697
Just shrimp all the time, man.

690
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,698
You must be my FNGs.

691
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,862
Morning, sir.

692
00:41:55,937 --> 00:41:57,461
Oh, get your hands down.

693
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:58,972
Do not salute me.

694
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:01,475
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

695
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:03,636
who'd love
to grease an officer.

696
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:06,977
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

697
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:09,808
What's wrong with your lip?

698
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:13,150
I was born with big gums, sir.

699
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:15,314
Well, you better tuck that in.

700
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,824
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.

701
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:21,495
Where are you boys
from in the world?

702
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:22,655
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

703
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:24,866
You twins?

704
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:29,696
No. We are not relations, sir.

705
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,035
Look,

706
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:34,439
it's pretty basic here.

707
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,772
You stick with me

708
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,278
and learn from the guys

709
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:40,280
who've been in country a while,

710
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:41,610
you'll be all right.

711
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:43,947
There is one item of G.I. Gear

712
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,113
that can be the difference
between life and death...

713
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,247
Socks.

714
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:50,348
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.

715
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:52,256
Try and keep your feet dry.

716
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:54,761
When we're out humpin',
change your socks

717
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,024
whenever we stop.

718
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:58,362
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet

719
00:42:58,433 --> 00:42:59,866
right off his legs.

720
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:01,368
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

721
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:03,870
where's that sling rope
I said to order?

722
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:05,372
I put in the requisitions.

723
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,704
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

724
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,869
<i>Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

725
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:12,880
<i>I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.</i>

726
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:16,611
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

727
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:19,210
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought</i>

728
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:20,754
<i>and died</i>

729
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:22,414
<i>in every...</i>

730
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:23,617
<i>single...</i>

731
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:25,785
<i>American war.</i>

732
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:27,795
God damn it, kick some ass.

733
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:29,125
Get on it!

734
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,630
<i>I guess you could say</i>

735
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:33,133
<i>he had a lot to live up to.</i>

736
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:36,136
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

737
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:37,296
Well,

738
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:39,135
I been through there.

739
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:41,971
Little Rock's a fine town.

740
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:43,806
Now, shake down your gear.

741
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,141
See the platoon sergeant.

742
00:43:45,213 --> 00:43:47,977
Draw what you need
for the field.

743
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:49,482
If you boys are hungry,

744
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:52,315
we got steaks burning
right over here.

745
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:55,151
Two standing orders
in this platoon...

746
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:57,748
1... take care of your feet,

747
00:43:57,826 --> 00:44:01,421
2... try not to do
anything stupid,

748
00:44:01,496 --> 00:44:03,088
like getting
yourself killed.

749
00:44:09,337 --> 00:44:11,862
I sure hope I don't
let him down.

750
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:25,986
<i>I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

751
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:28,454
<i>We would take
these real long walks.</i>

752
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:32,459
~ There must be
some kind of way ~

753
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:34,620
~ Out of here ~

754
00:44:34,696 --> 00:44:36,789
~ Said the joker
to the thief ~

755
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:38,298
<i>And we were always lookin'</i>

756
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:40,300
<i>for this guy named Charlie.</i>

757
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:41,960
~ There's too much confusion ~

758
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,135
~ I can't get no relief ~

759
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,802
Hold it up!

760
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:51,311
Hold up, boys!

761
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:55,907
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

762
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,249
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings</i>

763
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,415
<i>about a rock or a trail
or the road,</i>

764
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,425
<i>so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.</i>

765
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:06,585
Get down!

766
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:07,753
Shut up!

767
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,092
<i>So we did.</i>

768
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:29,880
<i>Now I don't know
much about anything,</i>

769
00:45:29,951 --> 00:45:32,886
<i>but I think some of
America's best young men</i>

770
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:34,216
<i>served in this war.</i>

771
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:36,553
<i>There was Dallas from Phoenix.</i>

772
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:40,723
<i>Cleveland...
he was from Detroit.</i>

773
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:43,587
Hey, Tex.

774
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:45,257
What the hell's going on?

775
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,528
<i>And Tex was...</i>

776
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:50,196
<i>Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from...</i>

777
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,796
Ah, nothing.

778
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,735
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

779
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:00,713
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

780
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:02,374
Move out.

781
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,884
1, 2! Hup!

782
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:07,721
Step it up!

783
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:09,120
Look alive out there.

784
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,623
<i>The good thing about Vietnam</i>

785
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:12,956
<i>is there was always
someplace to go.</i>

786
00:46:13,028 --> 00:46:14,290
Fire in the hole!

787
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:20,460
Gump, check out that hole.

788
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:23,470
<i>And there was always
something to do.</i>

789
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:24,630
Mount 'em up!

790
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:26,503
Spread out!
Cover his back!

791
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:34,173
<i>One day it started raining,</i>

792
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,582
<i>and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

793
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:41,088
<i>We've been through
every kind of rain there is...</i>

794
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:43,784
<i>little bitty stinging rain</i>

795
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:47,760
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

796
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:50,630
<i>rain that flew in sideways,</i>

797
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,424
<i>and sometimes rain even seemed</i>

798
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:55,831
<i>to come straight up
from underneath.</i>

799
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:59,428
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

800
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:01,268
Hey, Forrest.

801
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,432
Hey, Bubba.

802
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:04,772
I'm going to lean up against you.

803
00:47:04,844 --> 00:47:06,277
You lean up against me.

804
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:08,609
This way we don't have to sleep

805
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:10,615
with our heads in the mud.

806
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:13,277
You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?

807
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:16,617
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

808
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:18,452
like brothers and stuff.

809
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:21,951
Hey, Forrest,

810
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:24,121
something I been thinking about.

811
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:27,131
I got a very important
question to ask you.

812
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:30,802
How would you like to go

813
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,804
into the shrimping
business with me?

814
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:35,635
O.K.

815
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,471
Man, I tell you what.

816
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,807
I got it all figured out, too.

817
00:47:39,879 --> 00:47:41,312
So many pounds of shrimp

818
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,813
will pay off the boat.

819
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:44,315
So many pounds for gas.

820
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,317
We'll live right on the boat.

821
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,649
We ain't got to pay no rent.

822
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:50,655
We can just work it together,

823
00:47:50,723 --> 00:47:52,657
split everything right
down the middle.

824
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:54,818
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

825
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:57,920
Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

826
00:47:59,498 --> 00:48:02,092
That's a fine idea.

827
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,932
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

828
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,602
<i>I even wrote Jenny</i>

829
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:11,609
<i>and told her all about it.</i>

830
00:48:11,677 --> 00:48:13,269
<i>I sent her letters...</i>

831
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:15,438
<i>Not every day, but almost.</i>

832
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:17,778
<i>I told her what I was doing</i>

833
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,284
<i>and asked her what she was doing</i>

834
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:23,588
<i>and told her how
I thought about her always.</i>

835
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:26,890
<i>And how I was looking forward</i>

836
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,892
<i>to getting a letter from her</i>

837
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,724
<i>just as soon
as she had the time.</i>

838
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:34,731
<i>I'd always let her know
that I was O.K.</i>

839
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:42,228
<i>Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

840
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:54,913
~ There's somethin'
happenin' here ~

841
00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:59,848
<i>This one day, we was out
walking like always,</i>

842
00:48:59,924 --> 00:49:03,690
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

843
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:05,695
<i>somebody turned off the rain,</i>

844
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:07,355
<i>and the sun come out.</i>

845
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:10,195
~ I got to beware ~

846
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:12,360
Ambush!

847
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:14,370
Take cover!

848
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:25,616
Get that pig up here,
god damn it!

849
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:27,876
Forrest! You okay?

850
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:33,388
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

851
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:36,255
Hey! We got a man down!

852
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:39,784
Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

853
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:42,297
Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming

854
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:44,766
from the treeline at point blue

855
00:49:44,835 --> 00:49:47,167
plus two!
A.K.S and rockets!

856
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,499
We're getting it hard!

857
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:50,130
Misfire! Misfire!

858
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:53,005
God damn it!

859
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:58,514
Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!

860
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,944
They got us,
and it hurt.

861
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,512
We're going to move
back to the blue line.

862
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,491
Pull back! Pull back!

863
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,550
Forrest! Run, Forrest!

864
00:50:11,628 --> 00:50:13,357
Pull back!

865
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,625
Run! Run, man!

866
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:16,791
Run!

867
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,129
Pull back, Gump!

868
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,866
Run, God damn it! Run!

869
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:52,826
<i>I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

870
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:57,767
<i>I ran so far so fast</i>

871
00:50:57,841 --> 00:51:00,275
<i>that pretty soon
I was all by myself,</i>

872
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:01,935
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

873
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:03,104
Bubba.

874
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:07,775
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

875
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:10,285
<i>I had to make sure he was O.K.</i>

876
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:21,796
Where the hell are you?

877
00:51:21,865 --> 00:51:23,958
Bubba!

878
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:26,969
<i>And on my way
back to find Bubba,</i>

879
00:51:27,037 --> 00:51:29,801
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

880
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:30,862
Tex.

881
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:34,401
O.K.

882
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:36,912
<i>I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,</i>

883
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,413
<i>scared the way he was,</i>

884
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:40,245
<i>so I grabbed him up</i>

885
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:42,046
<i>and run him out of there.</i>

886
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,997
<i>Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

887
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,503
<i>somebody else was saying,</i>

888
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:04,506
<i>"Help me, Forrest, help me!"</i>

889
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:13,242
O.K. Here. Here.

890
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:18,521
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.

891
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:25,384
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

892
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:26,895
I know my position

893
00:52:26,963 --> 00:52:28,863
is danger close!

894
00:52:28,932 --> 00:52:31,366
We got Charlie
all over this area.

895
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:34,369
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

896
00:52:34,437 --> 00:52:36,871
Lieutenant Dan,
Coleman's dead!

897
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,373
I know he's dead!

898
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:41,376
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

899
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:42,877
God damn it!

900
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:44,880
What are you doing?

901
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,381
You leave me here!

902
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:48,383
Get away.
Just leave me here!

903
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:49,884
Get out!

904
00:52:49,953 --> 00:52:53,889
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

905
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:56,323
<i>Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.</i>

906
00:52:56,393 --> 00:52:59,362
<i>Be advised your fast movers
are inbound. Over.</i>

907
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,830
<i>Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

908
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:05,663
Aah! Something bit me!

909
00:53:09,406 --> 00:53:12,500
Aah! Aah!

910
00:53:12,576 --> 00:53:14,510
You son of a bitch!

911
00:53:14,578 --> 00:53:15,909
Aah!

912
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:19,005
I can't leave the platoon.

913
00:53:19,082 --> 00:53:22,017
I told you
to leave me there, Gump.

914
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:24,053
Forget about me.
Get yourself out!

915
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,350
Did you hear what I said?

916
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:28,857
Gump, damn it, put me down.

917
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,450
Get your ass out of here.

918
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,558
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

919
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:39,568
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

920
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,069
To get Bubba.

921
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:44,072
I got an air strike
inbound right now.

922
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,631
They're going to nape
the whole area.

923
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,177
Stay here!
That's an order.

924
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,678
I gotta find Bubba!

925
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:06,590
Forrest.

926
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:15,235
Bubba.

927
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:17,136
I'm O.K., Forrest.

928
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:18,731
I'm O.K.

929
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,175
O-Oh, Bubba, no.

930
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:31,049
I'll be all right.

931
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:40,521
Come on.

932
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:42,326
Come on. Come on.

933
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:48,999
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

934
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:53,876
I'm O.K. I'm fine.

935
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,406
Top smoke. Get it up there.

936
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:36,350
<i>If I'd have known
this was going to be</i>

937
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:39,354
<i>the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

938
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:42,357
<i>I'd of thought of
something better to say.</i>

939
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:43,483
Hey, Bubba.

940
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,822
Hey, Forrest.

941
00:55:47,263 --> 00:55:48,696
Forrest...

942
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,859
Why did this happen?

943
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,870
You got shot.

944
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:59,307
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

945
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:02,937
I want to go home.

946
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:05,811
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

947
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:07,816
<i>And even I know</i>

948
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:11,320
<i>that ain't something you can
find just around the corner.</i>

949
00:56:11,388 --> 00:56:14,824
<i>Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

950
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:19,191
<i>but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

951
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:27,100
That's all I have
to say about that.

952
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:31,500
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

953
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,843
A bullet?

954
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:37,641
That jumped up and bit you.

955
00:56:38,782 --> 00:56:40,647
Oh. Yes, sir.

956
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:43,345
Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.

957
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,857
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

958
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:49,858
the army must keep that money,

959
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:53,862
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

960
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,733
The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks

961
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:59,629
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

962
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:02,602
<i>They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.</i>

963
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:04,104
<i>And guess what?</i>

964
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:08,074
<i>A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.</i>

965
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:12,437
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

966
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:17,046
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

967
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:30,660
It's time for
your bath, Lieutenant.

968
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:40,306
Harper!

969
00:57:43,912 --> 00:57:45,345
Cooper.

970
00:57:45,413 --> 00:57:46,345
Larson.

971
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,678
Webster.

972
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:52,352
Gump.

973
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,853
Gump!

974
00:57:53,922 --> 00:57:55,549
I'm Forrest Gump.

975
00:57:57,859 --> 00:57:59,258
Kyle.

976
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:02,193
Nichols.

977
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:06,298
McMill.

978
00:58:06,368 --> 00:58:07,357
Johnson.

979
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:21,448
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

980
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,687
Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?

981
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,188
Turn it off.

982
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,690
<i>You are tuned
to the American forces</i>

983
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,192
<i>Vietnam network.</i>

984
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,818
<i>This is channel 6, Saigon.</i>

985
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,925
Good catch, Gump.

986
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,668
You know how to play this?

987
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,739
Come on. Let me show you.

988
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,709
Now, the secret to this game is

989
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,712
no matter what happens,

990
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,214
never, ever...

991
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,375
take your eye off the ball.

992
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,549
All right.

993
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,225
<i>For some reason,</i>

994
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,727
<i>Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

995
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,956
See?

996
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,225
Any idiot can play.

997
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,735
<i>So I started playing it
all the time.</i>

998
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,430
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

999
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:21,100
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

1000
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,883
<i>The hospital's people</i>

1001
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:34,887
<i>said it made me look
like a duck in water...</i>

1002
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:36,388
<i>Whatever that means.</i>

1003
00:59:36,457 --> 00:59:39,688
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.</i>

1004
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:46,898
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,</i>

1005
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:49,799
<i>I even played it in my sleep.</i>

1006
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:57,841
Now...

1007
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,343
you listen to me.

1008
00:59:59,412 --> 01:00:01,346
We all have a destiny.

1009
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:04,850
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

1010
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,909
I should have died
out there with my men,

1011
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:11,980
but now... I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

1012
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:13,753
a legless freak!

1013
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,919
Look. Look! Look at me!

1014
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:17,428
You see that?

1015
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:19,362
Do you know what it's like

1016
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:22,424
not to be able to use your legs?

1017
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:26,496
Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.

1018
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:32,706
Did you hear what I said?

1019
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,644
You cheated me!

1020
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,147
I had a destiny.

1021
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,740
I was supposed
to die in the field

1022
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:40,012
with honor!

1023
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:41,815
That was my destiny,

1024
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,857
and you...
cheated me out of it!

1025
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,765
You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1026
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,331
This wasn't supposed
to happen...

1027
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,204
Not to me.

1028
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,268
I had a destiny.

1029
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,839
I was...

1030
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,679
Lieutenant...

1031
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,480
Dan Taylor.

1032
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:20,292
Y-You still

1033
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,021
Lieutenant Dan.

1034
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:45,817
Look at me.

1035
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:49,821
What am I going to do now?

1036
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:55,190
What am I going to do now?

1037
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:06,531
PFC Gump?

1038
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:10,137
Yes, sir!

1039
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:11,608
As you were.

1040
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:13,837
Son,

1041
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:16,416
you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

1042
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,779
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1043
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,581
They want to give me a med...

1044
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,294
Ma'am.

1045
01:02:29,362 --> 01:02:31,796
What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

1046
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:33,729
They sent him home.

1047
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:43,740
<i>Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.</i>

1048
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,300
<i>The ceremony was kicked off</i>

1049
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:47,471
<i>with a candid speech
by the president</i>

1050
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:51,984
<i>regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.</i>

1051
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:55,987
<i>Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.</i>

1052
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:57,955
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

1053
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:01,826
<i>I understand you were wounded.</i>

1054
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:03,828
<i>Where were you hit?</i>

1055
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,488
<i>In the but-tocks, sir.</i>

1056
01:03:05,565 --> 01:03:07,499
<i>Well, that must be a sight.</i>

1057
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:10,331
<i>I'd kinda like to see that.</i>

1058
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:14,169
~ And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson ~

1059
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,300
~ Jesus loves you more
than you will know ~

1060
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:20,877
~ Whoa, whoa, whoa ~

1061
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:24,280
~ God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson ~

1062
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,011
God damn, son!

1063
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:31,290
<i>After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,</i>

1064
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:35,293
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

1065
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,295
Hilary! I got the vets.

1066
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:40,161
What do you want
to do with them?

1067
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,793
<i>It's a good thing
Mama was resting,</i>

1068
01:03:42,869 --> 01:03:45,804
<i>'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people</i>

1069
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:48,807
<i>lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,</i>

1070
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,810
<i>and some of them people
were loud and pushy.</i>

1071
01:03:51,878 --> 01:03:53,709
O.K., follow me!

1072
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:57,078
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

1073
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:04,948
Come on.

1074
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,013
Go!

1075
01:04:14,901 --> 01:04:18,268
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.

1076
01:04:18,337 --> 01:04:19,702
Good.

1077
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,262
O.K.

1078
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,275
<i>There was this man
giving a little talk.</i>

1079
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:25,776
<i>And for some reason,</i>

1080
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:28,780
<i>he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.</i>

1081
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:34,285
<i>And he liked to say
the "F" word... a lot.</i>

1082
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,617
<i>"F" this and "F" that.</i>

1083
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:39,658
<i>And every time
he said the "F" word,</i>

1084
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:42,785
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.</i>

1085
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:47,025
Yeah! Yeah!

1086
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:51,561
Come on, man.
Come up here, man.

1087
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,002
Come on. Come on.

1088
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:55,233
Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

1089
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:58,844
Go on. Let's get up there.

1090
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,350
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

1091
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:16,327
The war in Vietnam?

1092
01:05:16,395 --> 01:05:19,159
The war in Viet-

1093
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:20,789
fucking-nam!

1094
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,290
Well...

1095
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,294
<i>There was only one thing
I could say</i>

1096
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,795
<i>about the war in Vietnam.</i>

1097
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,798
There's only one thing
I can say about...

1098
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,356
the war in Vietnam.

1099
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,736
In Vietnam...

1100
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,818
What the hell are you do...

1101
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,821
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

1102
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,323
Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?

1103
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,360
Can't hear you!

1104
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:25,259
Can't hear anything!

1105
01:06:26,332 --> 01:06:27,264
This... This one!

1106
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,265
Give me that!

1107
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:30,894
Speak up!

1108
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,733
That's it.

1109
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:35,171
And that's all I have to say

1110
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,004
about that.

1111
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:45,544
That's so right on, man.

1112
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,085
You said it all.

1113
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,782
What's your name, man?

1114
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:54,292
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1115
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,918
Forrest Gump.

1116
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:57,257
- Gump! Gump!
- Gump!

1117
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,832
Forrest!

1118
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:03,334
Forrest!

1119
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:08,639
Jenny!

1120
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:09,732
Forrest!

1121
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:26,556
Hey!

1122
01:07:36,335 --> 01:07:40,169
<i>It was the happiest
moment of my life.</i>

1123
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:45,776
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

1124
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:47,278
<i>She showed me around</i>

1125
01:07:47,346 --> 01:07:50,281
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

1126
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:51,782
Shut that blind, man!

1127
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:54,786
And get your white ass
away from that window.

1128
01:07:54,854 --> 01:07:57,144
Don't you know we in a war here?

1129
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,120
He's cool.
He's one of us.

1130
01:07:59,189 --> 01:08:01,123
Let me tell you about us.

1131
01:08:01,191 --> 01:08:04,126
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

1132
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:06,662
from the racial
onslaught of the pig

1133
01:08:06,729 --> 01:08:09,562
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

1134
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,829
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

1135
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:14,301
Who's the baby killer?

1136
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,305
This is my good friend
I told you about.

1137
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:20,308
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

1138
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,810
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

1139
01:08:22,879 --> 01:08:25,814
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1140
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:28,817
We are here to offer
protection and help

1141
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,319
for all those
who need our help,

1142
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:32,820
because we,
the Black Panthers,

1143
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:34,823
are against the war in Vietnam.

1144
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:36,324
We are against any war

1145
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:39,327
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

1146
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:42,330
to die for a country
that hates them.

1147
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:46,334
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

1148
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:49,929
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

1149
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:52,907
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

1150
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,675
~ And I gave her the gun ~

1151
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:59,339
~ I shot her ~

1152
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:02,907
Forrest!

1153
01:09:02,986 --> 01:09:05,744
Stop it!

1154
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,085
Forrest!

1155
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,558
Stop it! Stop it!

1156
01:09:19,369 --> 01:09:21,803
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1157
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:26,570
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

1158
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:29,203
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

1159
01:09:34,384 --> 01:09:36,215
Come on, Forrest.

1160
01:09:41,324 --> 01:09:46,159
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

1161
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:50,764
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

1162
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,301
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1163
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:57,171
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.

1164
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:01,937
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

1165
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,582
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1166
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,290
You look handsome in it.

1167
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,089
You do.

1168
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:24,798
You know what?

1169
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:25,959
What?

1170
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,704
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

1171
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:35,801
Me, too, Forrest.

1172
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:39,336
<i>We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,</i>

1173
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:41,348
<i>just talkin'.</i>

1174
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:46,183
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done</i>

1175
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:50,123
<i>and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind</i>

1176
01:10:50,192 --> 01:10:53,796
<i>and learn how
to live in harmony...</i>

1177
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:55,829
<i>which must be
out west somewhere,</i>

1178
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:58,833
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

1179
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:00,835
~ Love one another right now ~

1180
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:01,835
Hey.

1181
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:05,203
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

1182
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:06,741
I'll go.

1183
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:08,140
Far out!

1184
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,644
<i>It was a very special night</i>

1185
01:11:10,712 --> 01:11:12,407
<i>for the two of us.</i>

1186
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:16,050
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

1187
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:19,084
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1188
01:11:20,355 --> 01:11:21,879
I have to, Forrest.

1189
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:24,290
Jenny?

1190
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:28,790
Things got
a little out of hand.

1191
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:30,456
It's just this war

1192
01:11:30,532 --> 01:11:33,296
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

1193
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:37,570
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

1194
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,275
Know what I think?

1195
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:45,712
I think...

1196
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:47,806
you should go home to Greenbow,

1197
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:49,874
Alabama!

1198
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:01,260
Forrest,

1199
01:12:02,397 --> 01:12:05,025
we have very
different lives, you know.

1200
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:15,843
I want you...

1201
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:18,004
to have this.

1202
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,841
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1203
01:12:25,854 --> 01:12:27,287
I got it...

1204
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:30,689
just by doing
what you told me to do.

1205
01:12:32,361 --> 01:12:35,626
Why are you so good to me?

1206
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:37,528
You're my girl.

1207
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:41,363
I'll always be your girl.

1208
01:13:04,293 --> 01:13:09,253
~ To everything,
turn, turn, turn ~

1209
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:13,825
~ There is a season,
turn, turn, turn ~

1210
01:13:13,902 --> 01:13:17,668
~ And a time to every purpose ~

1211
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,764
~ Under heaven ~

1212
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:23,776
<i>And just like that,</i>

1213
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:27,804
<i>she was gone
out of my life again.</i>

1214
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:30,849
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

1215
01:13:32,854 --> 01:13:35,652
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1216
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:43,297
<i>I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,</i>

1217
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:44,798
<i>but instead they decided</i>

1218
01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:47,801
<i>the best way for me
to fight the Communists</i>

1219
01:13:47,869 --> 01:13:49,302
<i>was to play Ping-Pong,</i>

1220
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:51,305
<i>so I was in the Special Services,</i>

1221
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:52,965
<i>traveling around the country,</i>

1222
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,669
<i>cheering up wounded veterans
and showing 'em</i>

1223
01:13:55,744 --> 01:13:57,302
how to play Ping-Pong.

1224
01:13:57,379 --> 01:14:00,348
I was so good
that some years later,

1225
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:02,315
<i>the army decided I should be</i>

1226
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:04,545
<i>on the all-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

1227
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:07,884
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

1228
01:14:07,956 --> 01:14:10,356
<i>in a million years or something.</i>

1229
01:14:10,425 --> 01:14:13,360
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

1230
01:14:13,428 --> 01:14:16,124
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

1231
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:19,065
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

1232
01:14:19,134 --> 01:14:21,034
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

1233
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:23,203
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump.</i>

1234
01:14:23,271 --> 01:14:24,636
<i>Right here.</i>

1235
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,448
<i>Gump, have a seat.</i>

1236
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:36,279
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

1237
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:38,285
<i>Welcome home.</i>

1238
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:40,287
<i>Can you tell us, um,</i>

1239
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,482
<i>what was China like?</i>

1240
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,786
<i>In the land of China...</i>

1241
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,797
<i>people hardly got nothin'at all.</i>

1242
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:52,026
<i>No possessions?</i>

1243
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:59,304
<i>And in China,
they never go to church.</i>

1244
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:00,807
<i>No religion, too?</i>

1245
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,810
<i>Oh.</i>

1246
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,470
<i>Hard to imagine.</i>

1247
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:07,811
<i>Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

1248
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:09,316
<i>Some years later,</i>

1249
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:11,318
<i>that nice young man from England</i>

1250
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:14,355
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

1251
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,323
<i>and was signing some autographs.</i>

1252
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:18,256
<i>For no particular reason at all,</i>

1253
01:15:18,326 --> 01:15:20,794
<i>somebody shot him.</i>

1254
01:15:23,331 --> 01:15:25,265
They gave you...

1255
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,324
the congressional Medal of Honor.

1256
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,534
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

1257
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:35,067
Lieutenant Dan!

1258
01:15:35,143 --> 01:15:37,008
They gave you...

1259
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,105
the congressional
Medal of Honor.

1260
01:15:41,349 --> 01:15:43,283
Yes, sir.
They surely did.

1261
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:45,182
They gave you,

1262
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:46,777
an imbecile,

1263
01:15:46,855 --> 01:15:48,789
a moron who goes on television

1264
01:15:48,857 --> 01:15:51,291
and makes a fool out of himself

1265
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:54,328
in front of
the whole damn country,

1266
01:15:54,396 --> 01:15:56,728
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1267
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,098
Yes, sir.

1268
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:04,600
<i>Well... that...
that's just perfect!</i>

1269
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:08,370
Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...

1270
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,809
Goddamn bless America.

1271
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,345
Hey, hey!

1272
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:14,404
Whoa...

1273
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:17,145
Oh, God, whoa!

1274
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,983
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

1275
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:21,682
Lieutenant Dan!

1276
01:16:21,756 --> 01:16:24,748
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel</i>

1277
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:27,761
<i>and because he didn't
have no legs,</i>

1278
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:30,764
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

1279
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,768
Make a right. Take a right!

1280
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:38,771
Hey!

1281
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,034
Ah, ah!

1282
01:16:40,108 --> 01:16:43,771
What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

1283
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:46,279
I'm living off
the government tit.

1284
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,777
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

1285
01:16:51,853 --> 01:16:53,286
I'm walking here!

1286
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:54,788
Ah, get out!

1287
01:16:54,856 --> 01:16:56,517
Come on. Go, go, go!

1288
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:04,290
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan</i>

1289
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:06,698
<i>and celebrated the holidays.</i>

1290
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:13,368
<i>You have a great year,
and hurry home.</i>

1291
01:17:13,441 --> 01:17:15,136
<i>God bless you.</i>

1292
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:20,507
Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?

1293
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:25,818
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.

1294
01:17:31,826 --> 01:17:35,284
That's all these cripples
down at the V. A...

1295
01:17:35,363 --> 01:17:38,764
That's all they ever
talk about.

1296
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:43,065
Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.

1297
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:46,630
Have I... found Jesus?

1298
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:50,144
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

1299
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:52,772
He said God is listening,

1300
01:17:52,847 --> 01:17:55,782
but I have to help myself.

1301
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,785
Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,

1302
01:17:58,853 --> 01:18:03,290
I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1303
01:18:03,358 --> 01:18:05,588
Did you hear what I said?

1304
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:08,658
Walk...

1305
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,290
beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1306
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:13,800
Well... kiss my crippled ass.

1307
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:15,802
God is listening?

1308
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,929
What a crock of shit.

1309
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:23,366
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.

1310
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,812
Oh?

1311
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:32,614
Well...

1312
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:36,747
before you go...
why don't you

1313
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:39,260
get your ass
down to the corner

1314
01:18:39,393 --> 01:18:41,054
and get us more Ripple?

1315
01:18:41,128 --> 01:18:42,152
Yes, sir.

1316
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:43,662
<i>We're at approximately</i>

1317
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:46,825
<i>45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.</i>

1318
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,834
<i>This is the site of the old...</i>

1319
01:18:48,902 --> 01:18:51,336
What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?

1320
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:52,838
Shrimping boats.

1321
01:18:52,906 --> 01:18:56,342
Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?

1322
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:58,344
I got to buy me one

1323
01:18:58,412 --> 01:19:00,346
soon as I have some money.

1324
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:01,847
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

1325
01:19:01,915 --> 01:19:05,351
that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.

1326
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:08,855
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

1327
01:19:08,922 --> 01:19:11,857
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

1328
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:13,859
A shrimp boat captain.

1329
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,021
Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1330
01:19:19,366 --> 01:19:21,300
Now hear this!

1331
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:22,801
Private Gump here

1332
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:25,304
is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

1333
01:19:25,372 --> 01:19:27,306
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1334
01:19:27,374 --> 01:19:30,309
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1335
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:33,312
I will come and be
your first mate.

1336
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,813
Ha ha ha!

1337
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:37,817
If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1338
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:39,819
that's the day
I'm an astronaut!

1339
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:41,821
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1340
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:43,322
Danny, how you doing, huh?

1341
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:44,823
Mr. Hot Wheels!

1342
01:19:44,892 --> 01:19:46,325
Who's your friend?

1343
01:19:46,393 --> 01:19:48,861
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1344
01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:51,363
This is cunning Carla

1345
01:19:51,432 --> 01:19:53,366
and long-limbs Lenore.

1346
01:19:53,434 --> 01:19:55,334
So where you been,
babycakes, huh?

1347
01:19:55,402 --> 01:19:57,336
Haven't seen you
around lately.

1348
01:19:57,404 --> 01:19:59,838
You should have been here
for Christmas,

1349
01:19:59,907 --> 01:20:01,841
'cause Tommy bought a free round

1350
01:20:01,909 --> 01:20:03,843
and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.

1351
01:20:03,911 --> 01:20:05,845
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.

1352
01:20:05,913 --> 01:20:07,847
Hey! Hey, we was just there!

1353
01:20:07,915 --> 01:20:09,849
That's like Times Square.

1354
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:12,351
Don't you just love New Year's?

1355
01:20:12,419 --> 01:20:14,853
You can start all over.

1356
01:20:14,922 --> 01:20:16,856
Everybody gets a second chance.

1357
01:20:16,924 --> 01:20:18,289
<i>It's funny...</i>

1358
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,294
<i>but in the middle
of all that fun,</i>

1359
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:23,193
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1360
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:26,699
<i>wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night</i>

1361
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,429
<i>out in California.</i>

1362
01:20:29,503 --> 01:20:32,802
~ Don't you love her ways? ~

1363
01:20:32,873 --> 01:20:35,967
~ Tell me what you say ~

1364
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:39,137
~ Don't you love her madly? ~

1365
01:20:39,213 --> 01:20:42,307
~ Want to meet her daddy? ~

1366
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:45,443
~ Don't you love her face? ~

1367
01:20:45,519 --> 01:20:50,320
~ Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? ~

1368
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:51,824
<i>9... 8...</i>

1369
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:53,826
<i>7... 6...</i>

1370
01:20:53,894 --> 01:20:55,828
<i>5... 4...</i>

1371
01:20:55,896 --> 01:20:57,363
<i>3... 2...</i>

1372
01:20:57,431 --> 01:20:58,363
<i>1!</i>

1373
01:20:58,432 --> 01:21:00,627
<i>Happy new year!</i>

1374
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:14,347
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

1375
01:21:14,415 --> 01:21:17,350
~ And never brought to mind ~

1376
01:21:17,418 --> 01:21:20,285
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

1377
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:25,053
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

1378
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:30,085
~ In days of auld lang syne ~

1379
01:21:39,139 --> 01:21:40,697
~ Together we stand ~

1380
01:21:40,774 --> 01:21:43,436
~ Divided we fall ~

1381
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,603
~ Come on now, people, let's ~

1382
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:46,611
~ Get on the ball ~

1383
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,910
~ And work together ~

1384
01:21:48,982 --> 01:21:50,711
~ Come on, come on ~

1385
01:21:50,784 --> 01:21:52,445
~ Let's work together ~

1386
01:21:54,888 --> 01:21:57,322
Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?

1387
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:58,824
What's your problem?

1388
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:00,325
What's his problem?

1389
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:03,329
Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?

1390
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:05,331
Is your friend
stupid or something?

1391
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:06,832
What did you say?

1392
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,334
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

1393
01:22:09,403 --> 01:22:10,665
Don't call him stupid!

1394
01:22:10,737 --> 01:22:12,170
Hey, don't push her!

1395
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,263
You shut up!

1396
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,240
Don't you ever call him stupid!

1397
01:22:15,309 --> 01:22:17,641
Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?

1398
01:22:17,711 --> 01:22:18,871
Get your goddamned clothes

1399
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:21,380
and get the hell out of here!

1400
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:23,279
You should be in a sideshow.

1401
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,476
You're so pathetic!

1402
01:22:24,551 --> 01:22:26,041
Get out of here!

1403
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:27,552
You big guy!

1404
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:29,589
Loser. You freak!

1405
01:22:34,361 --> 01:22:36,022
Oh, no. No.

1406
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:02,321
I'm sorry I ruined

1407
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:05,324
your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

1408
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:07,724
She tastes like cigarettes.

1409
01:23:23,844 --> 01:23:25,778
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured</i>

1410
01:23:25,846 --> 01:23:28,781
<i>there's some things
you just can't change.</i>

1411
01:23:28,849 --> 01:23:31,784
<i>He didn't want
to be called crippled</i>

1412
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:35,288
<i>just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.</i>

1413
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:41,486
Happy new year, Gump.

1414
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:47,791
<i>The U.S. Ping-Pong team</i>

1415
01:23:47,868 --> 01:23:49,301
<i>met with President Nixon today...</i>

1416
01:23:49,369 --> 01:23:50,996
Wouldn't you know it?

1417
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:52,800
A few months later,

1418
01:23:52,873 --> 01:23:55,808
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

1419
01:23:55,876 --> 01:23:57,309
to visit the White House.

1420
01:23:57,377 --> 01:23:58,776
So I went...

1421
01:23:58,845 --> 01:24:00,005
again.

1422
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,880
And I met the president
of the United States again.

1423
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,511
<i>Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms</i>

1424
01:24:06,587 --> 01:24:08,316
<i>in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1425
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:09,821
<i>Are you enjoying yourself</i>

1426
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,824
<i>in our nation's capital,
young man?</i>

1427
01:24:11,892 --> 01:24:13,325
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

1428
01:24:13,393 --> 01:24:14,826
<i>It's called the Hotel Ebbott.</i>

1429
01:24:14,895 --> 01:24:17,830
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.</i>

1430
01:24:17,898 --> 01:24:19,263
<i>It's brand-new. Very modern.</i>

1431
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:21,961
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it.</i>

1432
01:24:22,035 --> 01:24:23,263
Security.

1433
01:24:23,337 --> 01:24:24,770
Yeah. Sir,

1434
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:27,773
you might want to send
a maintenance man

1435
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:30,275
over to that office
across the way.

1436
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:31,777
The lights are off

1437
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:34,780
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

1438
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:37,783
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1439
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:39,785
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

1440
01:24:39,853 --> 01:24:41,150
Thank you. Good night.

1441
01:24:44,358 --> 01:24:45,791
<i>Therefore...</i>

1442
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:47,793
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

1443
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:50,125
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1444
01:24:50,197 --> 01:24:52,131
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1445
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:54,292
<i>will be sworn in as president</i>

1446
01:24:54,368 --> 01:24:57,030
<i>at that hour in this office.</i>

1447
01:25:08,148 --> 01:25:09,615
Forrest Gump.

1448
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:11,310
Yes, sir!

1449
01:25:11,385 --> 01:25:12,818
As you were.

1450
01:25:12,886 --> 01:25:14,820
I have your discharge papers.

1451
01:25:14,888 --> 01:25:16,549
Service is up, son.

1452
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:22,124
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

1453
01:25:22,195 --> 01:25:24,163
For the army, it does.

1454
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:28,267
<i>And just like that,</i>

1455
01:25:28,335 --> 01:25:31,771
<i>my service in
the United States Army was over.</i>

1456
01:25:36,343 --> 01:25:38,311
<i>So I went home.</i>

1457
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,524
I'm home, Mama.

1458
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:04,001
I know. I know.

1459
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:06,805
Louise, he's here.

1460
01:26:06,873 --> 01:26:09,808
<i>Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,</i>

1461
01:26:09,876 --> 01:26:12,310
<i>but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.</i>

1462
01:26:12,379 --> 01:26:14,313
We've had all sorts of visitors.

1463
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:17,817
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1464
01:26:17,884 --> 01:26:20,751
One man even left
a check for $25,000

1465
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:24,257
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

1466
01:26:24,324 --> 01:26:27,259
I only like using
my own paddle.

1467
01:26:27,327 --> 01:26:28,726
Hi, Miss Louise.

1468
01:26:28,795 --> 01:26:29,784
Hey, Forrest.

1469
01:26:29,863 --> 01:26:32,764
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1470
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:36,269
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

1471
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:38,770
see if it grows on you.

1472
01:26:38,839 --> 01:26:40,773
<i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1473
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:43,576
<i>It's funny how things work out.</i>

1474
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:45,609
<i>I didn't stay home for long</i>

1475
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:48,112
<i>because I'd made
a promise to Bubba,</i>

1476
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,614
<i>and I always try
to keep my promise,</i>

1477
01:26:50,683 --> 01:26:53,117
<i>so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre</i>

1478
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:54,675
<i>to meet Bubba's family.</i>

1479
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:59,156
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

1480
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:02,455
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

1481
01:27:02,528 --> 01:27:03,460
I guess.

1482
01:27:03,529 --> 01:27:04,962
<i>And, of course,</i>

1483
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:08,124
<i>I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.</i>

1484
01:27:09,368 --> 01:27:12,030
Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.

1485
01:27:15,374 --> 01:27:17,308
I remember everything
you said,

1486
01:27:17,376 --> 01:27:20,243
and I got it
all figured out.

1487
01:27:21,914 --> 01:27:28,547
I'm taking $24,562.47

1488
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:30,748
that I got, that's left

1489
01:27:30,823 --> 01:27:33,257
<i>after a new haircut
and a new suit</i>

1490
01:27:33,325 --> 01:27:36,260
<i>and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1491
01:27:36,328 --> 01:27:39,195
<i>and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1492
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,255
Tell me something.

1493
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,767
Are you stupid or something?

1494
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:46,532
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1495
01:27:46,605 --> 01:27:48,539
That's what's left
after me saying,

1496
01:27:48,607 --> 01:27:52,543
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1497
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:54,545
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

1498
01:27:54,613 --> 01:27:56,740
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

1499
01:27:56,815 --> 01:27:58,749
which everybody knows isn't true,

1500
01:27:58,817 --> 01:28:01,752
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

1501
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,754
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1502
01:28:03,822 --> 01:28:06,256
So anyway,
I'm putting all that

1503
01:28:06,325 --> 01:28:08,759
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1504
01:28:08,827 --> 01:28:11,762
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1505
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:36,321
<i>Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1506
01:28:36,388 --> 01:28:39,323
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1507
01:28:40,392 --> 01:28:42,952
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1508
01:28:44,897 --> 01:28:47,559
I only caught five.

1509
01:28:47,633 --> 01:28:51,069
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1510
01:28:52,905 --> 01:28:55,840
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

1511
01:28:55,908 --> 01:28:58,843
It's bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

1512
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:01,345
<i>I'd never named a boat before,</i>

1513
01:29:01,413 --> 01:29:06,441
<i>but there was only one
I could think of,</i>

1514
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:10,477
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1515
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,050
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

1516
01:29:16,128 --> 01:29:18,096
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

1517
01:29:18,163 --> 01:29:22,463
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

1518
01:29:22,534 --> 01:29:24,729
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

1519
01:29:24,803 --> 01:29:26,566
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

1520
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:28,265
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

1521
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,432
<i>~ Whoo ~</i>

1522
01:29:29,508 --> 01:29:30,805
<i>~ Get down tonight... ~</i>

1523
01:29:30,876 --> 01:29:33,276
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny</i>

1524
01:29:33,345 --> 01:29:34,642
<i>in a long while,</i>

1525
01:29:34,713 --> 01:29:37,147
<i>but I thought about her a lot.</i>

1526
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:40,310
<i>I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1527
01:29:40,385 --> 01:29:45,413
~ Oh, and the bird
you cannot change ~

1528
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:55,562
~ And this bird
you cannot change ~

1529
01:29:55,634 --> 01:30:03,006
~ Lord knows I can't change ~

1530
01:30:03,075 --> 01:30:10,004
~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~

1531
01:31:26,224 --> 01:31:29,660
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1532
01:31:52,984 --> 01:31:55,077
Hey!

1533
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:23,206
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1534
01:32:23,281 --> 01:32:26,648
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

1535
01:32:26,718 --> 01:32:29,653
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1536
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:31,154
Yes, I know that.

1537
01:32:31,222 --> 01:32:35,420
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

1538
01:32:35,493 --> 01:32:37,859
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

1539
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,796
I had to see this for myself...

1540
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,567
and...

1541
01:32:43,635 --> 01:32:48,072
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1542
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:50,073
that I'd be your first mate.

1543
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:51,802
Well, here I am.

1544
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:53,810
I'm a man of my word.

1545
01:32:53,878 --> 01:32:54,902
O.K.

1546
01:32:54,979 --> 01:32:57,140
But don't you be thinking

1547
01:32:57,215 --> 01:32:59,649
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

1548
01:32:59,717 --> 01:33:00,649
No, sir.

1549
01:33:09,193 --> 01:33:10,717
It's my boat.

1550
01:33:13,898 --> 01:33:17,994
I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1551
01:33:18,069 --> 01:33:21,630
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1552
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:24,474
Take a left!

1553
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:25,474
Which way?

1554
01:33:25,543 --> 01:33:26,475
Over there!

1555
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:27,977
They're over there!

1556
01:33:28,046 --> 01:33:31,379
Get on the wheel
and take a left.

1557
01:33:31,449 --> 01:33:32,882
O.K.

1558
01:33:34,218 --> 01:33:36,152
Gump, what are you doing?

1559
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,653
Take a left!

1560
01:33:37,722 --> 01:33:38,711
Left!

1561
01:33:40,591 --> 01:33:44,527
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1562
01:33:44,595 --> 01:33:45,527
Ha ha!

1563
01:33:45,596 --> 01:33:47,723
That's where we'll find them.

1564
01:34:00,144 --> 01:34:02,078
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1565
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:04,080
O.K., so I was wrong.

1566
01:34:04,148 --> 01:34:07,083
Well, how are we
going to find them?

1567
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:11,178
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1568
01:34:11,255 --> 01:34:13,917
~ So pray that ~

1569
01:34:13,992 --> 01:34:17,257
~ I'm homeward bound... ~

1570
01:34:17,328 --> 01:34:20,024
<i>So I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1571
01:34:21,466 --> 01:34:23,400
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1572
01:34:23,468 --> 01:34:27,336
<i>though I think he left
the praying up to me.</i>

1573
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:43,252
No shrimp.

1574
01:34:44,355 --> 01:34:47,290
Where the hell's
this God of yours?

1575
01:34:47,358 --> 01:34:49,792
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that</i>

1576
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:53,731
<i>'cause right then God showed up.</i>

1577
01:35:09,379 --> 01:35:11,813
You'll never sink this boat!

1578
01:35:11,882 --> 01:35:14,544
<i>Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1579
01:35:14,618 --> 01:35:18,679
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1580
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:19,745
Come on!

1581
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:24,590
You call this a storm?

1582
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:28,597
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1583
01:35:28,665 --> 01:35:32,601
It's time for a showdown!

1584
01:35:32,669 --> 01:35:34,136
You and me!

1585
01:35:34,204 --> 01:35:37,264
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

1586
01:35:37,341 --> 01:35:39,866
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1587
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,376
You'll never sink...

1588
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:42,742
this...

1589
01:35:42,813 --> 01:35:43,905
boat!

1590
01:35:43,981 --> 01:35:45,915
Ha ha ha ha!

1591
01:35:45,983 --> 01:35:48,118
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

1592
01:35:48,251 --> 01:35:50,048
destroying nearly
everything in its path.

1593
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,055
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1594
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:55,921
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1595
01:35:55,992 --> 01:35:58,324
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen</i>

1596
01:35:58,394 --> 01:36:01,227
<i>and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1597
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:02,730
<i>This reporter has learned,</i>

1598
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:05,233
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat</i>

1599
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,825
<i>actually survived the storm.</i>

1600
01:36:06,903 --> 01:36:09,371
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1601
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:12,533
<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

1602
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:15,373
~ There will be great bounty ~

1603
01:36:15,445 --> 01:36:18,107
~ Oh, my God... ~

1604
01:36:18,181 --> 01:36:20,115
<i>Since people still
needed them shrimps</i>

1605
01:36:20,183 --> 01:36:22,549
<i>for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all</i>

1606
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:25,554
and we were the only boat
left standing,

1607
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:28,056
Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.

1608
01:36:28,124 --> 01:36:31,059
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1609
01:36:31,127 --> 01:36:33,061
<i>12 Jennys, big old warehouse.</i>

1610
01:36:33,129 --> 01:36:35,063
We even have hats

1611
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:37,565
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1612
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:39,067
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1613
01:36:39,135 --> 01:36:40,568
It's a household name.

1614
01:36:40,637 --> 01:36:42,298
Hold on there, boy.

1615
01:36:42,372 --> 01:36:44,806
Are you telling me
you're the owner

1616
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:47,104
of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?

1617
01:36:47,177 --> 01:36:50,112
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1618
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:53,115
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,

1619
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:56,118
but that tops them all.

1620
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:58,154
Ha ha ha ha!

1621
01:36:58,221 --> 01:37:01,622
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

1622
01:37:04,627 --> 01:37:09,621
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1623
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,759
and you tell it so well,

1624
01:37:12,835 --> 01:37:14,928
with such enthusiasm.

1625
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:19,100
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1626
01:37:19,175 --> 01:37:21,405
Yes, I would.

1627
01:37:25,682 --> 01:37:27,309
That's him right there.

1628
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,612
Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.

1629
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:34,179
Forrest...

1630
01:37:39,362 --> 01:37:43,492
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1631
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:11,125
<i>He never actually said so,</i>

1632
01:38:11,194 --> 01:38:15,563
<i>but I think
he made his peace with God.</i>

1633
01:38:22,338 --> 01:38:25,136
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1634
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,642
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1635
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:30,645
<i>Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.</i>

1636
01:38:30,713 --> 01:38:32,146
<i>Jenny 1. Go, Margo.</i>

1637
01:38:32,215 --> 01:38:34,149
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1638
01:38:34,217 --> 01:38:38,654
Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.

1639
01:38:38,721 --> 01:38:41,155
He is indisposed at the moment.

1640
01:38:41,224 --> 01:38:42,691
<i>His mama's sick.</i>

1641
01:39:01,778 --> 01:39:02,710
Where's Mama?

1642
01:39:02,779 --> 01:39:04,576
She's upstairs.

1643
01:39:07,016 --> 01:39:08,745
Hi, Forrest.

1644
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,013
I'll see you tomorrow.

1645
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:12,384
Oh, all right.

1646
01:39:18,761 --> 01:39:21,594
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1647
01:39:33,776 --> 01:39:35,266
What's the matter, Mama?

1648
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:38,508
I'm dying, Forrest.

1649
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,551
Come on in,
sit down over here.

1650
01:39:57,266 --> 01:39:59,393
Why are you dying, Mama?

1651
01:39:59,469 --> 01:40:01,562
It's my time.

1652
01:40:01,637 --> 01:40:04,697
It's just my time.

1653
01:40:04,774 --> 01:40:06,799
Oh, now...

1654
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:10,437
don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.

1655
01:40:10,513 --> 01:40:13,914
Death is just a part of life.

1656
01:40:13,983 --> 01:40:17,942
Something we're all
destined to do.

1657
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,352
I didn't know it,

1658
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:23,358
but I was destined
to be your mama.

1659
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:26,156
I did the best I could.

1660
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,163
You did good.

1661
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:34,500
Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1662
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:39,098
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1663
01:40:42,612 --> 01:40:45,206
What's my destiny, Mama?

1664
01:40:45,281 --> 01:40:49,718
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1665
01:40:51,053 --> 01:40:53,988
Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.

1666
01:40:54,056 --> 01:40:56,991
You never know what
you're going to get.

1667
01:40:57,059 --> 01:40:59,994
<i>Mama always had a way
of explaining things</i>

1668
01:41:00,062 --> 01:41:01,996
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

1669
01:41:02,064 --> 01:41:03,531
I will miss you, Forrest.

1670
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:07,532
<i>She had got the cancer</i>

1671
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:09,537
<i>and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1672
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:12,199
<i>I bought her a new hat</i>

1673
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:14,300
<i>with little flowers on it.</i>

1674
01:41:17,246 --> 01:41:19,942
And that's all I have
to say about that.

1675
01:41:27,223 --> 01:41:29,919
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?

1676
01:41:29,992 --> 01:41:32,722
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1677
01:41:36,232 --> 01:41:40,669
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1678
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,671
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1679
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:45,172
and a college graduate,

1680
01:41:45,241 --> 01:41:47,675
the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

1681
01:41:47,743 --> 01:41:50,234
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1682
01:41:51,747 --> 01:41:55,274
<i>So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1683
01:41:55,351 --> 01:41:58,286
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.</i>

1684
01:41:58,354 --> 01:42:01,289
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1685
01:42:01,357 --> 01:42:03,791
<i>So then I got a call from him</i>

1686
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,420
<i>saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,</i>

1687
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:10,899
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1688
01:42:10,967 --> 01:42:12,764
~ I've got a new hope... ~

1689
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:15,269
<i>Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune</i>

1690
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:16,965
<i>a man really needs,</i>

1691
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,440
<i>and the rest
is just for showing off.</i>

1692
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:23,411
<i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i>

1693
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:26,744
<i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i>

1694
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:31,879
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i>

1695
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:35,790
<i>and even though Bubba was dead</i>

1696
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:39,294
<i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1697
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:42,092
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1698
01:42:45,468 --> 01:42:47,129
You know what?

1699
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:51,139
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1700
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:53,801
That smells wonderful.

1701
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,310
<i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i>

1702
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:59,314
<i>and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1703
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:02,818
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1704
01:43:04,253 --> 01:43:07,689
<i>But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do</i>

1705
01:43:07,757 --> 01:43:10,191
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1706
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:13,194
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1707
01:44:16,759 --> 01:44:20,559
<i>And then... she was there.</i>

1708
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:54,625
Hello, Forrest.

1709
01:44:54,696 --> 01:44:56,891
Hello, Jenny.

1710
01:45:07,743 --> 01:45:10,871
<i>Jenny came back
and stayed with me.</i>

1711
01:45:10,946 --> 01:45:15,781
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1712
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:19,218
<i>or maybe it was because
she was so tired</i>

1713
01:45:19,288 --> 01:45:22,724
<i>'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept</i>

1714
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:25,021
<i>like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1715
01:45:25,093 --> 01:45:27,459
<i>It was wonderful
having her home.</i>

1716
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:29,963
<i>Every day we'd take a walk,</i>

1717
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:33,968
<i>and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1718
01:45:34,036 --> 01:45:36,971
<i>and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping</i>

1719
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,974
<i>and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.</i>

1720
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:41,976
<i>I did all the talking.</i>

1721
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:44,535
<i>Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.</i>

1722
01:46:24,186 --> 01:46:26,916
How could you do this?

1723
01:47:04,226 --> 01:47:08,720
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1724
01:47:10,232 --> 01:47:13,167
<i>I never really knew
why she came back,</i>

1725
01:47:13,235 --> 01:47:14,668
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

1726
01:47:14,736 --> 01:47:16,670
<i>It was like olden times.</i>

1727
01:47:16,738 --> 01:47:19,536
<i>We was like
peas and carrots again.</i>

1728
01:47:21,176 --> 01:47:23,610
<i>Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers</i>

1729
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:27,240
<i>and put them in her room for her,</i>

1730
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:30,752
<i>and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get</i>

1731
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,252
<i>in the wide world.</i>

1732
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:34,846
They're made just for running.

1733
01:47:34,923 --> 01:47:36,185
<i>~ Carry me home to see my kin ~</i>

1734
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:41,385
<i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i>

1735
01:47:43,231 --> 01:47:45,597
<i>~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~</i>

1736
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:46,895
<i>~ And I think it's a sin ~</i>

1737
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,831
<i>~ Sweet home Alabama... ~</i>

1738
01:47:49,905 --> 01:47:54,933
<i>Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...</i>

1739
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:01,043
<i>and it was the happiest time
in my life.</i>

1740
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:26,673
You done watching it?

1741
01:48:26,742 --> 01:48:27,674
Mm-hmm.

1742
01:48:27,743 --> 01:48:29,734
I'm going to bed.

1743
01:48:40,655 --> 01:48:42,213
Will you marry me?

1744
01:48:47,261 --> 01:48:50,230
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1745
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,667
You would, Forrest.

1746
01:48:57,105 --> 01:48:58,868
But you won't marry me.

1747
01:49:01,275 --> 01:49:03,675
You don't want to marry me.

1748
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:09,181
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1749
01:49:14,622 --> 01:49:16,556
I'm not a smart man,

1750
01:49:16,624 --> 01:49:21,084
but I know what love is.

1751
01:49:57,999 --> 01:49:59,261
Jenny...

1752
01:50:01,335 --> 01:50:03,633
Forrest, I do love you.

1753
01:50:56,657 --> 01:50:59,251
Where are you running off to?

1754
01:50:59,327 --> 01:51:00,885
I'm not running.

1755
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:33,287
<i>That day,</i>

1756
01:52:33,354 --> 01:52:34,787
<i>for no particular reason,</i>

1757
01:52:34,855 --> 01:52:37,847
<i>I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1758
01:52:37,925 --> 01:52:41,383
<i>So I ran to the end of the road,</i>

1759
01:52:41,462 --> 01:52:44,795
<i>and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.</i>

1760
01:52:44,865 --> 01:52:47,493
<i>President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...</i>

1761
01:52:47,568 --> 01:52:49,559
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1762
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:53,573
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

1763
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:56,075
<i>Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,</i>

1764
01:52:56,143 --> 01:53:00,011
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1765
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:02,015
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1766
01:53:02,083 --> 01:53:04,074
<i>I ran clear across Alabama.</i>

1767
01:53:04,151 --> 01:53:08,679
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1768
01:53:08,756 --> 01:53:10,690
I ran clear to the ocean.

1769
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,522
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1770
01:53:17,598 --> 01:53:20,032
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far,</i>

1771
01:53:20,101 --> 01:53:23,264
<i>might as well turn around,
just keep on going.</i>

1772
01:53:25,306 --> 01:53:28,366
<i>And when I got to another ocean,</i>

1773
01:53:28,442 --> 01:53:31,377
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far...</i>

1774
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,578
<i>I might as well just turn back</i>

1775
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:37,242
<i>and keep right on going.</i>

1776
01:53:37,318 --> 01:53:40,651
<i>When I got tired, I slept.</i>

1777
01:53:40,721 --> 01:53:42,814
<i>When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1778
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:45,324
When I had to go...

1779
01:53:45,393 --> 01:53:46,417
you know...

1780
01:53:47,561 --> 01:53:48,721
I went.

1781
01:53:48,796 --> 01:53:49,990
And so...

1782
01:53:50,064 --> 01:53:52,089
you just ran.

1783
01:53:53,734 --> 01:53:55,292
Yeah.

1784
01:53:55,369 --> 01:53:59,066
~ Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels ~

1785
01:54:02,243 --> 01:54:05,110
~ Lookin' back
at the years gone by ~

1786
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:07,477
~ Like so many summer fields ~

1787
01:54:09,083 --> 01:54:12,314
~ In '65, I was 17 ~

1788
01:54:12,386 --> 01:54:14,820
~ And runnin' up one on one ~

1789
01:54:16,257 --> 01:54:18,851
~ I don't know
where I'm runnin' now ~

1790
01:54:18,926 --> 01:54:22,020
~ I'm just runnin' on ~

1791
01:54:22,096 --> 01:54:23,859
~ Runnin' on ~

1792
01:54:23,931 --> 01:54:25,865
~ Runnin' on empty ~

1793
01:54:25,933 --> 01:54:27,332
~ Runnin' on ~

1794
01:54:27,401 --> 01:54:29,198
~ Runnin' dry ~

1795
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:30,202
~ Runnin' on... ~

1796
01:54:30,271 --> 01:54:31,863
<i>I'd think a lot...</i>

1797
01:54:31,939 --> 01:54:36,205
<i>about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1798
01:54:36,277 --> 01:54:37,801
<i>But most of all,</i>

1799
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:39,869
<i>I thought about Jenny.</i>

1800
01:54:39,947 --> 01:54:42,711
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1801
01:54:44,185 --> 01:54:45,777
<i>For more than two years,</i>

1802
01:54:45,853 --> 01:54:47,582
<i>a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1803
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:50,647
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1804
01:54:50,725 --> 01:54:52,989
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1805
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:55,153
<i>Charles Cooper
brings you this report.</i>

1806
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:56,491
<i>For the fourth time</i>

1807
01:54:56,564 --> 01:54:58,156
<i>on his journey across America,</i>

1808
01:54:58,232 --> 01:55:00,666
<i>Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1809
01:55:00,735 --> 01:55:03,499
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1810
01:55:03,571 --> 01:55:05,004
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1811
01:55:05,072 --> 01:55:07,006
<i>Sir, where are you running?</i>

1812
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:09,508
Are you doing this
for world peace?

1813
01:55:09,577 --> 01:55:12,011
Are you doing this
for the homeless?

1814
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:14,013
Are you running
for women's rights?

1815
01:55:14,081 --> 01:55:15,013
The environment?

1816
01:55:15,082 --> 01:55:16,344
<i>They just couldn't believe</i>

1817
01:55:16,417 --> 01:55:18,851
<i>that somebody would do
all that running</i>

1818
01:55:18,919 --> 01:55:20,352
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1819
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:22,013
Why are you doing this?

1820
01:55:22,089 --> 01:55:24,353
I just felt like running.

1821
01:55:24,425 --> 01:55:26,052
I just felt like runnin'.

1822
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:28,060
That's you.

1823
01:55:28,129 --> 01:55:30,723
I can't believe it's really you.

1824
01:55:30,798 --> 01:55:32,231
Now... for some reason,

1825
01:55:32,299 --> 01:55:34,733
what I was doing seemed to...

1826
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:36,326
make sense to people.

1827
01:55:36,403 --> 01:55:39,338
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1828
01:55:39,406 --> 01:55:42,432
I said, "Here's a guy
that's got his act together.

1829
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:44,444
Here's somebody
who has the answer."

1830
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:46,446
I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1831
01:55:46,514 --> 01:55:48,846
<i>So I got company.</i>

1832
01:55:50,384 --> 01:55:52,944
<i>And after that,
I got more company.</i>

1833
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:56,547
<i>And then, even
more people joined in.</i>

1834
01:55:58,559 --> 01:56:00,293
<i>Somebody later told me</i>

1835
01:56:00,426 --> 01:56:01,984
it gave people hope.

1836
01:56:03,562 --> 01:56:04,722
Now...

1837
01:56:04,797 --> 01:56:07,288
Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1838
01:56:07,366 --> 01:56:09,800
<i>but some of those people asked me</i>

1839
01:56:09,869 --> 01:56:11,803
<i>if I could help them out.</i>

1840
01:56:11,871 --> 01:56:14,305
I was wondering
if you might help me.

1841
01:56:14,373 --> 01:56:16,307
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1842
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:17,967
I need a good slogan,

1843
01:56:18,044 --> 01:56:19,978
and since you've
been so inspirational,

1844
01:56:20,046 --> 01:56:22,640
I thought you might
be able to help me...

1845
01:56:22,715 --> 01:56:24,478
Whoa, man! You just ran

1846
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:26,848
through a big pile of dog shit!

1847
01:56:28,087 --> 01:56:29,679
It happens.

1848
01:56:29,755 --> 01:56:31,120
What, shit?

1849
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:33,488
Sometimes.

1850
01:56:35,928 --> 01:56:38,396
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fella</i>

1851
01:56:38,464 --> 01:56:40,728
<i>did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan</i>

1852
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:44,065
<i>and made a lot of money
off of it.</i>

1853
01:56:44,136 --> 01:56:46,070
<i>Another time,
I was running along.</i>

1854
01:56:46,138 --> 01:56:49,073
<i>Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1855
01:56:49,141 --> 01:56:52,577
<i>he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,</i>

1856
01:56:52,645 --> 01:56:54,579
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,</i>

1857
01:56:54,647 --> 01:56:56,581
<i>and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1858
01:56:56,649 --> 01:57:00,085
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1859
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:06,290
Have a nice day.

1860
01:57:07,893 --> 01:57:09,827
<i>Some years later, I found out</i>

1861
01:57:09,895 --> 01:57:13,331
<i>that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1862
01:57:13,399 --> 01:57:15,560
<i>He made a lot of money.</i>

1863
01:57:17,903 --> 01:57:19,837
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,</i>

1864
01:57:19,905 --> 01:57:22,840
<i>I had a lot of company.</i>

1865
01:57:22,908 --> 01:57:24,341
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1866
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:27,345
<i>"You got to put the past
behind you</i>

1867
01:57:27,413 --> 01:57:29,847
<i>before you can move on. "</i>

1868
01:57:29,915 --> 01:57:33,851
<i>And I think that's
what my running was all about.</i>

1869
01:57:35,254 --> 01:57:37,848
<i>I had run for three years...</i>

1870
01:57:37,923 --> 01:57:39,857
<i>two months...</i>

1871
01:57:39,925 --> 01:57:42,018
<i>14 days, and 16 hours.</i>

1872
01:57:57,209 --> 01:57:59,700
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1873
01:58:11,223 --> 01:58:13,248
I'm pretty tired.

1874
01:58:15,895 --> 01:58:17,988
Think I'll go home now.

1875
01:58:35,915 --> 01:58:38,509
<i>Now what are we supposed to do?</i>

1876
01:58:39,752 --> 01:58:41,344
<i>And just like that...</i>

1877
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,622
<i>my runnin'days was over.</i>

1878
01:58:46,025 --> 01:58:48,357
<i>So I went home to Alabama.</i>

1879
01:58:48,561 --> 01:58:50,791
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,</i>

1880
01:58:50,863 --> 01:58:53,297
<i>as President Reagan
was leaving the...</i>

1881
01:58:55,201 --> 01:58:57,135
<i>Five or six gunshots were fired</i>

1882
01:58:57,203 --> 01:58:59,137
<i>by an unknown, would-be assassin.</i>

1883
01:58:59,205 --> 01:59:01,639
<i>The president was
shot in the chest...</i>

1884
01:59:01,707 --> 01:59:03,299
I picked up the mail.

1885
01:59:03,375 --> 01:59:05,969
<i>And one day, out
of the blue clear sky,</i>

1886
01:59:06,045 --> 01:59:08,240
<i>I got a letter from Jenny</i>

1887
01:59:08,314 --> 01:59:10,748
wondering if I could
come down to Savannah

1888
01:59:10,816 --> 01:59:14,252
and see her, and that's
what I'm doing here.

1889
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,252
Uh-huh.

1890
01:59:15,321 --> 01:59:17,755
She saw me on TV... running.

1891
01:59:17,823 --> 01:59:22,317
I'm supposed to go on
the number 9 bus to Richmond Street

1892
01:59:22,394 --> 01:59:25,329
and get off and go one block left

1893
01:59:25,397 --> 01:59:27,831
to 1947 Henry Street...

1894
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,162
apartment 4.

1895
01:59:29,235 --> 01:59:32,830
Why, you don't need
to take a bus.

1896
01:59:32,905 --> 01:59:36,841
Henry Street is just
five or six blocks...

1897
01:59:36,909 --> 01:59:38,843
down that way.

1898
01:59:38,911 --> 01:59:40,344
Down that way?

1899
01:59:40,412 --> 01:59:41,845
Down that way.

1900
01:59:43,749 --> 01:59:46,081
It was nice talking to you.

1901
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:50,854
I hope everything
works out for you!

1902
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:58,919
Hey!

1903
02:00:00,099 --> 02:00:02,192
Forrest!

1904
02:00:02,268 --> 02:00:04,031
How you doin'?

1905
02:00:04,103 --> 02:00:05,536
Come in! Come in!

1906
02:00:05,604 --> 02:00:07,037
I got your letter.

1907
02:00:07,106 --> 02:00:09,040
Oh, I was wondering
about that.

1908
02:00:10,943 --> 02:00:12,376
This your house?

1909
02:00:12,444 --> 02:00:14,036
Yeah. It's messy right now.

1910
02:00:14,113 --> 02:00:16,047
I just got off work.

1911
02:00:16,115 --> 02:00:18,208
It's nice.

1912
02:00:18,284 --> 02:00:20,149
You got air-conditioning.

1913
02:00:23,122 --> 02:00:24,054
Uh...

1914
02:00:26,292 --> 02:00:27,554
Thank you.

1915
02:00:27,626 --> 02:00:29,059
I ate some.

1916
02:00:31,463 --> 02:00:36,196
I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook
of... of your clippings and...

1917
02:00:36,268 --> 02:00:38,168
everything. There you are.

1918
02:00:40,139 --> 02:00:42,004
Yes, I got you running.

1919
02:00:44,076 --> 02:00:47,170
I ran a long way.

1920
02:00:47,246 --> 02:00:48,907
It's a long time.

1921
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,239
There...

1922
02:00:59,258 --> 02:01:01,852
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1923
02:01:01,927 --> 02:01:02,859
Um...

1924
02:01:05,431 --> 02:01:06,363
I just...

1925
02:01:06,432 --> 02:01:07,865
I want to apologize

1926
02:01:07,933 --> 02:01:11,869
for anything that I ever
did to you 'cause...

1927
02:01:11,937 --> 02:01:13,370
I was messed up...

1928
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:15,031
for a long time, and...

1929
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:17,541
Yoo-hoo!

1930
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:18,542
Hey!

1931
02:01:18,611 --> 02:01:19,543
Hi.

1932
02:01:19,612 --> 02:01:20,544
Hey, you.

1933
02:01:20,613 --> 02:01:23,047
This is my old friend
from Alabama.

1934
02:01:23,115 --> 02:01:24,707
How do you do?

1935
02:01:24,783 --> 02:01:28,241
Next week
my schedule changes, so I can...

1936
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,754
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1937
02:01:30,823 --> 02:01:31,790
O.K. Thanks.

1938
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,894
This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump.

1939
02:01:36,962 --> 02:01:38,224
Can you say hi?

1940
02:01:38,297 --> 02:01:39,730
Hello, Mr. Gump.

1941
02:01:39,798 --> 02:01:40,662
Hello.

1942
02:01:40,733 --> 02:01:42,963
Can I go watch TV now?

1943
02:01:43,035 --> 02:01:44,866
Yes. Just keep it low.

1944
02:01:47,072 --> 02:01:48,835
You're a mama, Jenny.

1945
02:01:48,907 --> 02:01:50,374
I'm a mama.

1946
02:01:53,712 --> 02:01:55,145
His name's Forrest.

1947
02:01:56,582 --> 02:01:57,514
Like me!

1948
02:01:58,917 --> 02:02:01,351
I named him after his daddy.

1949
02:02:02,588 --> 02:02:06,354
He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?

1950
02:02:06,425 --> 02:02:07,858
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1951
02:02:22,775 --> 02:02:24,367
Hey...

1952
02:02:24,443 --> 02:02:25,876
Forrest, look at me.

1953
02:02:25,944 --> 02:02:28,412
Look at me, Forrest.

1954
02:02:30,449 --> 02:02:32,383
There's nothing you need to do.

1955
02:02:32,451 --> 02:02:34,385
You didn't do anything wrong.

1956
02:02:35,454 --> 02:02:36,386
O.K.?

1957
02:02:40,893 --> 02:02:42,622
Isn't he beautiful?

1958
02:02:43,896 --> 02:02:46,831
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1959
02:02:50,903 --> 02:02:51,835
But...

1960
02:02:55,407 --> 02:02:57,841
is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1961
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:59,502
He's very smart.

1962
02:02:59,578 --> 02:03:02,775
He's one of
the smartest in his class.

1963
02:03:11,423 --> 02:03:14,017
Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him.

1964
02:03:23,435 --> 02:03:24,868
What are you watching?

1965
02:03:24,937 --> 02:03:26,370
Bert and Ernie.

1966
02:03:49,393 --> 02:03:50,587
Forrest...

1967
02:03:52,563 --> 02:03:53,894
I'm sick.

1968
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,836
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1969
02:03:59,904 --> 02:04:03,340
I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,

1970
02:04:03,407 --> 02:04:05,341
they don't know what it is,

1971
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:08,503
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1972
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:15,343
You could come home with me.

1973
02:04:17,088 --> 02:04:18,680
Jenny, you and...

1974
02:04:18,756 --> 02:04:19,688
little Forrest

1975
02:04:19,757 --> 02:04:21,190
could come stay

1976
02:04:21,258 --> 02:04:23,556
at my house in Greenbow.

1977
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:30,025
I'll take care of you
if you're sick.

1978
02:04:32,269 --> 02:04:34,362
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1979
02:04:40,277 --> 02:04:41,244
O.K.

1980
02:04:42,413 --> 02:04:44,142
Please take your seats.

1981
02:04:47,718 --> 02:04:48,980
Forrest?

1982
02:04:49,053 --> 02:04:50,714
It's time to start.

1983
02:05:09,573 --> 02:05:10,505
Hi.

1984
02:05:11,742 --> 02:05:13,073
Your tie.

1985
02:05:25,823 --> 02:05:28,087
Lieutenant Dan.

1986
02:05:42,873 --> 02:05:44,500
Lieutenant Dan.

1987
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:47,199
Hello, Forrest.

1988
02:05:47,278 --> 02:05:49,803
You got new legs.

1989
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:51,814
New legs!

1990
02:05:51,882 --> 02:05:54,976
Yeah. I got new legs.

1991
02:05:55,052 --> 02:05:56,314
Custom-made.

1992
02:05:56,387 --> 02:05:57,479
Titanium alloy.

1993
02:05:57,555 --> 02:06:00,649
It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1994
02:06:04,395 --> 02:06:06,022
Magic legs.

1995
02:06:07,898 --> 02:06:08,830
This...

1996
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,424
is my fiancée.

1997
02:06:11,502 --> 02:06:12,434
Susan.

1998
02:06:14,905 --> 02:06:17,465
Lieutenant Dan.

1999
02:06:17,541 --> 02:06:19,634
Hi, Forrest.

2000
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:22,178
Lieutenant Dan...

2001
02:06:22,246 --> 02:06:23,838
this is my Jenny.

2002
02:06:23,914 --> 02:06:27,179
Hi. It's nice
to meet you finally.

2003
02:06:37,461 --> 02:06:40,021
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

2004
02:06:40,097 --> 02:06:41,564
to be your wife?

2005
02:06:43,367 --> 02:06:45,801
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

2006
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:47,462
to be your husband?

2007
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:52,497
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

2008
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:25,533
Hi.

2009
02:07:38,589 --> 02:07:39,988
Hey, Forrest...

2010
02:07:45,362 --> 02:07:47,853
were you scared in Vietnam?

2011
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:50,963
Yes.

2012
02:07:51,035 --> 02:07:52,627
Well, l...

2013
02:07:52,703 --> 02:07:54,830
I don't know.

2014
02:07:54,905 --> 02:07:56,964
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining</i>

2015
02:07:57,041 --> 02:08:00,442
<i>long enough for
the stars to come out...</i>

2016
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:05,314
<i>and then it was nice.</i>

2017
02:08:08,586 --> 02:08:11,646
It was like just
before the sun goes to bed

2018
02:08:11,722 --> 02:08:13,121
down on the bayou.

2019
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:17,923
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water...</i>

2020
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:21,857
<i>like that mountain lake.</i>

2021
02:08:21,932 --> 02:08:23,866
<i>It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

2022
02:08:23,934 --> 02:08:26,869
<i>it looked like
there were two skies</i>

2023
02:08:26,937 --> 02:08:28,871
<i>one on top of the other.</i>

2024
02:08:30,574 --> 02:08:33,941
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

2025
02:08:36,413 --> 02:08:37,846
<i>I couldn't tell</i>

2026
02:08:37,915 --> 02:08:43,717
<i>where heaven stopped
and the earth began.</i>

2027
02:08:45,022 --> 02:08:47,183
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

2028
02:08:51,262 --> 02:08:54,288
I wish I could've
been there with you.

2029
02:08:57,534 --> 02:08:59,525
You were.

2030
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,475
I love you.

2031
02:09:15,552 --> 02:09:18,680
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

2032
02:09:20,557 --> 02:09:24,653
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

2033
02:09:29,066 --> 02:09:32,502
And I had that house
of your father's

2034
02:09:32,569 --> 02:09:34,833
bulldozed to the ground.

2035
02:09:38,075 --> 02:09:39,269
<i>Mama...</i>

2036
02:09:40,411 --> 02:09:42,345
always said

2037
02:09:42,413 --> 02:09:46,509
that dyin' was a part of life.

2038
02:09:49,086 --> 02:09:50,849
I sure wish it wasn't.

2039
02:09:54,258 --> 02:09:55,782
Little Forrest is...

2040
02:09:57,094 --> 02:09:59,358
doing just fine.

2041
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:00,419
"But..."

2042
02:10:00,497 --> 02:10:02,931
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

2043
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,025
<i>and...</i>

2044
02:10:05,102 --> 02:10:08,367
<i>and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner</i>

2045
02:10:08,439 --> 02:10:09,497
every day.

2046
02:10:11,275 --> 02:10:12,867
I make sure he...

2047
02:10:14,278 --> 02:10:15,711
combs his hair

2048
02:10:15,779 --> 02:10:17,872
and brushes his teeth every day.

2049
02:10:20,117 --> 02:10:22,677
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

2050
02:10:24,955 --> 02:10:26,388
<i>He's really good.</i>

2051
02:10:26,457 --> 02:10:28,550
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2052
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:29,683
Uhh!

2053
02:10:33,130 --> 02:10:34,563
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

2054
02:10:37,968 --> 02:10:40,334
And every night,
we read a book.

2055
02:10:40,404 --> 02:10:41,837
He's so smart, Jenny.

2056
02:10:44,908 --> 02:10:47,001
You'd be so proud of him.

2057
02:10:48,746 --> 02:10:50,008
I am.

2058
02:10:51,415 --> 02:10:54,578
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

2059
02:10:55,919 --> 02:10:58,854
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

2060
02:10:58,922 --> 02:11:01,857
so I'll just leave it
here for you.

2061
02:11:18,108 --> 02:11:20,043
Jenny...

2062
02:11:24,947 --> 02:11:27,882
I don't know
if Mama was right

2063
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:31,044
or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.

2064
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:32,985
I don't know...

2065
02:11:34,123 --> 02:11:36,785
if we each have a...

2066
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,086
destiny...

2067
02:11:40,563 --> 02:11:44,329
or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

2068
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:45,833
on a breeze...

2069
02:11:50,073 --> 02:11:52,007
but l... I think...

2070
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:55,673
maybe it's both.

2071
02:11:59,916 --> 02:12:03,147
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

2072
02:12:08,925 --> 02:12:10,859
But I miss you, Jenny.

2073
02:12:17,433 --> 02:12:19,424
If there's anything
you need...

2074
02:12:20,603 --> 02:12:22,537
I won't be far away.

2075
02:12:56,906 --> 02:12:59,340
Here's your bus.

2076
02:12:59,408 --> 02:13:00,773
O.K.

2077
02:13:00,843 --> 02:13:03,334
Hey...

2078
02:13:03,412 --> 02:13:04,845
I know this.

2079
02:13:04,914 --> 02:13:07,348
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

2080
02:13:07,416 --> 02:13:10,579
because Grandma used
to read it to you.

2081
02:13:10,653 --> 02:13:12,712
My favorite book.

2082
02:13:16,192 --> 02:13:17,625
Here we are.

2083
02:13:17,693 --> 02:13:19,024
Hey...

2084
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:22,363
here you go.

2085
02:13:27,537 --> 02:13:29,095
Hey, Forrest...

2086
02:13:29,172 --> 02:13:30,639
don't...

2087
02:13:33,442 --> 02:13:35,967
I want to tell you
I love you.

2088
02:13:36,045 --> 02:13:38,013
I love you, too, Daddy.

2089
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:40,947
I'll be right here
when you get back.

2090
02:13:46,389 --> 02:13:49,825
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

2091
02:13:49,892 --> 02:13:53,658
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
