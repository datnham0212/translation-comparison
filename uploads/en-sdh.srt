(BUS APPROACHING)

2
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,701
Hello.

3
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,329
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

4
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,920
Do you want a chocolate?

5
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,926
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

6
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:44,307
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

7
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
You never know what you're gonna get.

8
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,947
Those must be comfortable shoes.

9
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,995
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,666
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,877
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,755
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,049
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

14
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,137
where they're going,
where they've been.

15
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,438
I've worn lots of shoes.

16
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:39,362
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

17
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,910
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

18
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,330
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

19
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,583
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

20
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,343
Let's take a little walk around.

21
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,935
How do those feel?

22
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,065
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

23
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
as strong as I've ever seen,

24
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,112
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

25
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,534
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

26
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,701
Forrest!

27
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,</i>

28
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,332
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

29
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,835
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

30
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,128
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

31
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>And what he did was,</i>

32
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

33
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,346
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

34
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

35
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

36
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,858
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

37
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,359
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

38
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,194
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

39
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,823
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

40
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

41
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,160
(CLANG)

42
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,877
Okay... Get it, get it...

43
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,921
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

44
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,340
All right...

45
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,593
What are you all staring at?

46
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,139
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

47
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,394
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

48
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,063
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

49
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,274
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

50
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things</i>

51
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,153
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,116
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,585
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

56
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,587
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

57
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,589
<i>something like that.</i>

58
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,383
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

59
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

60
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,263
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

61
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,309
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

62
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,103
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

63
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,940
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

64
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:25,028
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

65
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,908
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

66
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:34,162
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

67
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,125
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

68
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,419
Now, his IQ is 75.

69
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,340
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

70
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,971
<i>FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

71
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,975
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

72
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,310
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

73
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,689
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,025
Now, this is normal.

75
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,821
Forrest is right here.

76
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:14,202
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

77
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,580
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

78
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,791
Now, he'll be just fine.

79
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,669
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

80
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,131
He might be a bit on the slow side,

81
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,050
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

82
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,636
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

83
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,515
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

84
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,768
We're talking about
five little points here.

85
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,106
There must be something can be done.

86
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,152
We're a progressive school system.

87
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,905
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

88
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,243
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

89
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,373
He's on vacation.

90
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,127
(GASPING AND PANTING)

91
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,644
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

92
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,611
You don't say much, do you?

93
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,159
(GASPING AND PANTING)

94
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,083
"Finally, he had to try.

95

"oh, what happened.

97
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,758
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

98
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,886
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

99
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,225
Vacation's when you go somewhere

100
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,938
and you don't ever come back.

101
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,071
<i>FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.</i>

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,909
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

103
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,578
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

104
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,746
MRS. GUMP: Supper.

105
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,250
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

106
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,877
<i>FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

107
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,630
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

108
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,342
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

109
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,387
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,890
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

111
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,518
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

112
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,230
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

(SINGING <i>HOUND DOG)</i>

114
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,206
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

116
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,544
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

117
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,589
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

118
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,633
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

119
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,888
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

120
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,848
Slow it down some.

<i>It sounded good.</i>

124
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,277
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

<i>swinging my hips.</i>

126
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,326
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

127
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,412
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

128

<i>had himself a heart attack,

135
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,111
Must be hard being a king.

00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,244
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

137
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,873
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

<i>FORREST: I remember the bus ride

Are you coming along?

140
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,013
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

141
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,266
This is the bus to school.

I don't recall what I got

on my first outdoor picnic.

152
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,702
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

Well, are you gonna sit down,

What's wrong with your legs?

158

Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

161

...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

162
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,613
These are going to make me...

163
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:28,409
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

164
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,912
Are you stupid or something?

165
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,998
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

166
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,295
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,880
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

504
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,300
I can't help it. I love you.

505
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,763
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

506
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,065
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

507
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,445
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

508
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,782
Yes, I do.

509
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,580
You think I could fly off this bridge?

510
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,422
What do you mean, Jenny?

511
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,803
Nothing.

512
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,808
I gotta get out of here.

513
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,228
Wait, Jenny...

514
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,774
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

515
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,109
Can I have a ride?

516
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,777
- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.

517
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,195
Get in the truck.

518
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,114
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

519
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,952
They sending me to Vietnam.

520
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,124
It's this whole other country.

521
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,628
Just hang on a minute.

522
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,133
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

523
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,511
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

524
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,221
Just run away.

525
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,807
Okay.

526
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,022
Jenny.

527
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,192
I'll write you all the time.

528
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

529
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,766
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

530
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,063
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

531
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,983
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

532
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:30,113
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

533
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,334
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

534
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,587
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

535
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,258
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

536
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,551
we can get American shrimpers

537
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,344
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

538
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,971
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

539
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,266
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

540
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,893
You must be my FNGs.

541
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

542
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,939
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

543
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,108
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

544
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,028
who would love to grease an officer.

545
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,614
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

546
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,951
What's wrong with your lip?

547
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,370
I was born with big gums, sir.

548
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:24,167
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

549
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,711
Where you boys from in the world?

550
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,172
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

551
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,382
You twins?

552
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,887
No, we are not relations, sir.

553
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,059
Look, it's pretty basic here.

554
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,312
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

555
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,106
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

556
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,108
There is one item of GI gear

557
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,321
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

558
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,824
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

559
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,201
Try and keep your feet dry.

560
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,744
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

561
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,330
to change your socks whenever we stop.

562
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,333
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

563
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,710
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

564
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,253
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

565
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,255
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

566
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,341
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

567
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,010
<i>FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

568
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,346
<i>I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

569
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,558
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

570
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,853
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

571
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>in every single American war.</i>

572
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,028
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

573
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,238
Get on it!

574
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,699
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

575
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:45,248
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

576
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,542
Little Rock's a fine town.

577
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,796
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

578
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,382
draw what you need for the field.

579
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,386
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

580
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,389
Two standing orders in this platoon:

581
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,100
one, take good care of your feet,

582
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:09,272
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

583
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,822
I sure hope I don't let him down.

584
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,919
<i>FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

585
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,338
<i>We would take these real long walks.</i>

586
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,934
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

587
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,028
DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!

588
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

589
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,621
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

590
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

591
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,836
Get down! Shut up!

592
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,255
<i>(WHISPERING) ...so we did.</i>

593
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,983
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

594
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,904
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

595
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,698
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

596
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,203
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

597
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,705
(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

598
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,999
Man, what the hell's going on?

599
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

600
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,047
DAN: Nothing.

601
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,679
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

602
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,516
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

603
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,351
Come on, move out.

604
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,855
Step it up. Look alive out there.

605
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:19,235
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

606
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,736
DAN: Fire in the hole!

607
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,534
Gump, check out that hole.

608
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,620
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

609
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,873
- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.

610
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,551
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

611
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,430
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

612
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,099
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

613
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,477
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

614
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,647
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

615
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,776
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

616
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,947
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

617
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,451
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

618
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,912
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

619
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,791
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

620
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,254
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

621
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,798
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

622
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,800
like brothers and stuff.

623
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,431
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

624
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,517
I got a very important question
to ask you.

625
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:39,106
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

626
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,942
Okay.

627
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,446
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

628
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,324
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

629
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,786
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

630
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,121
We ain't got to pay no rent.

631
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,290
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

632
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,628
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

633
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,298
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

634
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,635
That's a fine idea.

635
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,846
<i>FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

636
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,728
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

637
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,732
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

638
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:26,821
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

639
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,657
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

640
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,994
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

641
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,539
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

642
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,918
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

643
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:47,383
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

644
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:06,026
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

645
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,029
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

646
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,367
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

647
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,205
DAN: Ambush!

648
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,082
Take cover!

649
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,625
(GUNS FIRING)

650
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,879
Get down!

651
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,422
Get the sixty!

652
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,719
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

653
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,888
Forrest, you okay?

654
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,727
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

655
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,730
Medic, we got a man down!

656
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,733
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

657
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,778
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

658
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,407
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

659
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,868
Misfire! Misfire!

660
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,247
DAN: God damn it! Mac!

661
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,627
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

662
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,754
Jesus!

663
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,089
My unit is down hard and hurting!

664
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,760
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

665
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,554
Pull back! Pull back!

666
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,723
Run! Run, Forrest!

667
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,142
- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!

668
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,895
Run, man! Run!

669
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,730
DAN: Pull back! Run!

670
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,776
Run, God damn it, run!

671
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:54,593
SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?

672
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,305
<i>FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

673
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,938
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

674
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,940
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

675
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,025
Bubba!

676
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,948
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

677
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,704
SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?

678
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,832
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.

679
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,459
Where the hell are you?

680
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,378
Bubba?

681
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,173
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

682
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,135
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

683
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,386
Tex!

684
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,514
Okay.

685
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:44,518
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,</i>

686
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,522
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

687
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,081
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

688
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,710
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

689
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,261
Can't hear... Can't hear...

690
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,890
SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.

691
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,434
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

692
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,522
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

693
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,857
<i>MAN ON RADIO: ...over.</i>

694
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:35,235
DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

695
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,112
We got Charlie all over this area.

696
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,573
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

697
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,035
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

698
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,286
I know he's dead!

699
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,247
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

700
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,749
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

701
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,543
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

702
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,922
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

703
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,383
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

704
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,094
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

705
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,305
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

706
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,432
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

707
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,894
<i>FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

708
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,438
Something bit me!

709
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,447
You chink son of a bitch!

710
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,952
I can't leave the platoon.

711
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,998
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

712
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,251
Did you hear what I said?

713
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,920
God damn it, put me down!

714
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,673
Get your ass out of here!

715
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,595
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

716
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,972
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

717
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,181
To get Bubba.

718
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:50,144
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

719
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,646
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

720
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,190
I gotta find Bubba!

721
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,624
BUBBA: Forrest.

722
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:23,051
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

723
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,512
I'm okay.

724
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,189
Oh, Bubba, no...

725
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,524
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

726
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,278
(MEN CHATTERING)

727
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,368
Come on. Come on. Come on.

728
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,875
I'm okay, Forrest.

729
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,046
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

730
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,211
DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

731
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,758
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

732
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,219
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

733
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,762
Hey, Bubba.

734
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,265
Hey, Forrest.

735
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,812
Forrest, why'd this happen?

736
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,940
You got shot.

737
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,821
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

738
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,282
I wanna go home.

739
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,327
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

740
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:17,833
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

741
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,086
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

742
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,090
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

743
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,098
That's all I have to say about that.

744
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,644
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

745
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,649
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

746
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,154
Oh, yes, sir.

747
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:50,324
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

748
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:55,704
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

749
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,666
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

750
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,004
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

751
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,839
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

752
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,550
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

753
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,010
<i>And guess what?</i>

754
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,180
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

755
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,477
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

756
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,023
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

757
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,037
MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

758
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,880
Harper!

759
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,552
Cooper, Larson,

760
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,098
Webster,

761
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,019
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

762
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,859
Kyle, Nichols,

763
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:16,034
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

764
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,745
Holiday...

765
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,754
<i>MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

766
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,593
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

767
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,262
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

768
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,598
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

769
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,059
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

770
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,439
SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.

771
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,568
You know how to play this?

772
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,946
Come on, let me show you. Here.

773
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,367
Now, the secret to this game is,

774
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:03,290
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

775
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,211
All right.

776
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,218
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

777
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,472
See? Any idiot can play.

778
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,725
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

779
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,269
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

780
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,606
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

781
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:40,327
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

782
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,287
<i>whatever that means.</i>

783
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,999
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

784
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,383
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

785
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,313
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

786
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,399
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

787
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,194
I should have died out there
with my men,

788
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,323
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

789
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,993
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

790
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,870
Do you see that?

791
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,707
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

792
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,671
Yes, sir, I do.

793
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,385
Did you hear what I said?

794
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,054
You cheated me.

795
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,264
I had a destiny.

796
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,892
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

797
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,605
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

798
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,951
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

799
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,456
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

800
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,752
I had a destiny.

801
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,092
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

802
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,601
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

803
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,334
Look at me.

804
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,629
What am I gonna do now?

805
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,343
What am I gonna do now?

806
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,188
PFC Gump?

807
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,149
Yes, sir!

808
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,318
As you were.

809
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,656
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

810
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,327
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

811
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,837
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

812
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,548
They sent him home.

813
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,307
<i>FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

814
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,895
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

815
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,357
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

816
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,567
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

817
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,319
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

818
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,322
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

819
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,120
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

820
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,373
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

821
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,418
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

822
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,139
(CHUCKLING)

823
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,017
<i>God damn, son.</i>

824
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:37,981
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

825
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,568
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

826
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,236
ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

827
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,779
what do you want me to do with them?

828
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,614
HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?

829
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:50,744
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

830
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,997
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

831
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,708
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

832
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,753
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

833
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,548
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

834
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,345
HILARY: Follow me, let's go!

835
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,765
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,397
Stand here.

837
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,028
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

838
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,447
Okay.

1489
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,154
I named him after his daddy.

1490
02:02:09,113 --> 02:02:11,574
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1491
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:14,911
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1492
02:02:29,384 --> 02:02:30,593
Hey.

1493
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:34,639
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1494
02:02:37,225 --> 02:02:41,354
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1495
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:43,273
Okay?

1496
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,487
Isn't he beautiful?

1497
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:53,449
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1498
02:02:57,245 --> 02:02:58,329
But...

1499
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,919
Is he smart, or...

1500
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:08,965
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1501
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:20,768
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1502
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:32,947
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1503
02:03:56,054 --> 02:03:57,847
Forrest,

1504
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:00,850
I'm sick.

1505
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:07,190
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1506
02:04:07,231 --> 02:04:09,651
I have some kind of virus,

1507
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:12,403
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1508
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:15,531
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1509
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:22,205
You could come home with me.

1510
02:04:23,873 --> 02:04:29,545
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1511
02:04:33,883 --> 02:04:36,678
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1512
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:41,349
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1513
02:04:46,604 --> 02:04:47,855
Okay.

1514
02:04:48,898 --> 02:04:50,566
MINISTER: Please take your seats.

1515
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:56,739
Forrest? It's time to start.

1516
02:05:16,134 --> 02:05:17,719
Hi.

1517
02:05:18,594 --> 02:05:20,096
Your tie.

1518
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,277
Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:51,586
Lieutenant Dan.

1520
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,088
Hello, Forrest.

1521
02:05:54,756 --> 02:05:57,425
You got new legs. New legs!

1522
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:02,430
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1523
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:07,143
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1524
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:12,482
Magic legs.

1525
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:18,863
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1526
02:06:21,657 --> 02:06:25,036
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1527
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:30,333
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1528
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:33,711
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1529
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:48,017
MINISTER: Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1530
02:06:49,894 --> 02:06:54,148
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1531
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:58,861
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1532
02:07:29,725 --> 02:07:31,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

1533
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,076
Hey, Forrest.

1534
02:07:52,415 --> 02:07:54,208
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1535
02:07:55,877 --> 02:07:58,212
Yes. Well, I...

1536
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:01,257
I don't know.

1537
02:08:01,966 --> 02:08:06,929
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1538
02:08:10,057 --> 02:08:12,101
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1539
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:19,442
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1540
02:08:20,735 --> 02:08:24,614
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1541
02:08:26,407 --> 02:08:30,328
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1542
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:35,041
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1543
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:40,630
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1544
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:47,261
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1545
02:08:47,803 --> 02:08:50,181
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1546
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:53,309
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1547
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:01,108
I wish I could've been there with you.

1548
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,613
You were.

1549
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:17,792
I love you.

1550
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:25,508
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1551
02:09:27,218 --> 02:09:30,972
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1552
02:09:35,851 --> 02:09:40,690
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1553
02:09:44,819 --> 02:09:46,487
<i>Mama</i>

1554
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:52,576
always said that dying was a part of life.

1555
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:58,332
I sure wish it wasn't.

1556
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:04,755
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1557
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,174
But...

1558
02:10:07,425 --> 02:10:10,094
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1559
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:15,725
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1560
02:10:17,893 --> 02:10:23,899
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1561
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:29,613
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1562
02:10:30,906 --> 02:10:31,949
Okay.

1563
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:33,409
<i>He's really good.</i>

1564
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:35,578
Forrest, you go.

1565
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,375
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1566
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:48,382
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1567
02:10:51,635 --> 02:10:53,888
You'd be so proud of him.

1568
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:57,058
I am.

1569
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:01,312
He wrote you a letter.

1570
02:11:02,897 --> 02:11:04,940
And he says I can't read it.

1571
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:08,611
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1572
02:11:24,668 --> 02:11:26,003
Jenny,

1573
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:35,012
I don't know if Mama was right,

1574
02:11:36,347 --> 02:11:37,848
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1575
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:40,601
I don't know

1576
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:45,147
if we each have a destiny,

1577
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:52,321
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1578
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:58,661
But I think

1579
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:02,331
maybe it's both.

1580
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:09,547
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1581
02:12:15,678 --> 02:12:17,680
But I miss you, Jenny.

1582
02:12:24,061 --> 02:12:28,482
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1583
02:13:03,767 --> 02:13:06,729
Here's your bus. Okay.

1584
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:11,734
Hey. I know this.

1585
02:13:11,859 --> 02:13:14,737
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1586
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:17,573
Grandma used to read it to you.

1587
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:19,742
My favorite book.

1588
02:13:23,078 --> 02:13:24,580
Here we are.

1589
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,207
Okay.

1590
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:29,418
Here you go.

1591
02:13:34,298 --> 02:13:36,800
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1592
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:43,974
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1593
02:13:45,976 --> 02:13:48,771
I'll be right here when you get back.

1594
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:56,612
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1595
02:13:56,654 --> 02:14:00,199
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
