00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:46,130
Hi, I'm Wendy Finerman,
one of the producers of <i>Forrest Gump,</i>

2
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,133
and it gives me great pleasure
that with this DVD

3
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:54,389
we will be able to bring Forrest
into many more homes across the world.

4
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,312
I think what's so rewarding here
is that Forrest is a little bit of everyone,

5
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:06,568
and when I first read the novel
<i>Forrest Gump,</i> by Winston Groom,

6
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,405
I imagined what the world would be like

7
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,784
if everybody had come in contact
with a man like Forrest.

8
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,414
He was so honest. He was so simple.

9
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:26,337
He had a way of looking at people,
incidents, history, animals, nature

10
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,009
in ways that I don't think anybody
had ever quite seen the world before.

11
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,803
And with a lot of effort,

12
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,765
on hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of people's parts,

13
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,269
I think that the movie that was made

14
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:47,150
took that story to a level that was higher
than any of us had ever imagined.

15
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:14,469
Eric Roth wrote the blueprint
for the movie

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,726
that everybody else... So graciously

17
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:28,775
and diligently and in a dignified way
just kind of made it, just, to a level

18
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,569
that none of us
could have ever imagined.

19
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,709
The icing on the cake
for this amazing screenplay

20
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,420
was to have Tom Hanks
as Forrest Gump.

21
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:54,133
Even though Forrest appears as such
a simpleton, he's truly very complex.

22
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,096
There is no one else
who could have played this role.

23
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,445
The image of Forrest
sitting on the bus bench

24
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,281
is exactly how the screenplay starts,

25
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:21,994
and the feather is the touch
that Eric brought us into,

26
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,372
and I think his intention was destiny.

27
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,584
I think when Bob let that feather float
in the beginning of the movie

28
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,878
and ended up right at Forrest's toe,

29
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:34,924
it set the tone for the wonderful journey
that was ahead of us.

30
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,734
Tom came to play this part
because Eric and Tom and I

31
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,403
had been actually working
on another project together,

32
00:03:55,486 --> 00:04:00,074
and we had talked to Tom
about doing it,

33
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,244
and he, kind of,
was somewhat interested,

34
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,081
and once Eric came aboard, yeah,
he was somewhat interested,

35
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:12,170
and once Eric wrote the screenplay,
Tom was there.

36
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,255
You know, there was no question

37
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,467
about what the screenplay did,
in terms of moving all of us.

38
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,761
And there was really only one man
that we thought

39
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:23,389
could give the screenplay its life,
and that was Bob Zemeckis.

40
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,475
Because we had no idea
who else there would be

41
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:29,645
that could mix both the magic,
the imagery,

42
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:35,359
and be able to take us places visually
that we'd never gone before.

43
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,448
And obviously Bob went so far beyond
our wildest imaginations in doing that.

44
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,039
One of the things that I remember,
in the beginning,

45
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:52,585
sitting down and talking to Bob about,
was his vision of the movie.

46
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,546
And one of the things, the images
that he talked about in particular

47
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,966
with the scene with the doctor's office,
was Norman Rockwell.

48
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,803
And he talked about Americana,

49
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,431
and he even talked about
that industrial avocado-green.

50
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,936
And he always
wanted to present a picture

51
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,605
that could be accessible to anybody,

52
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,983
and so anybody could kind of
put themselves in that place,

53
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,861
so therefore, they would have
an easier way of understanding

54
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:23,491
who Forrest was in that place.
And just like this doctor that we see,

55
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,993
and we've all seen
those kind of medicine cabinets,

56
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:27,829
and we've all seen that kind of room,

57
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:32,208
made us very comfortable in meeting
this very, very unusual character.

58
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,674
I think what gave Forrest the strength,
from his inception, was his mother.

59
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,342
'Cause his mother always said,

60
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,011
"You know what, Forrest? You're not
more different than anyone else,"

61
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,055
I think were her exact words.

62
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,850
And she allowed him
to have the confidence

63
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,601
that I think all of us as parents today

64
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,771
wish that we are able
to give our own children.

65
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,362
Bob's vision of mixing mediums,
in terms of stock footage

66
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,365
and special effects
and other things like that,

67
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,286
were also able to take us
where Forrest's imagination took us.

68
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,561
Bob knew exactly what he wanted to do

69
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,481
when he put Forrest
in the kind of braces that he put on him.

70
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,902
From the beginning of imagining
what he would be like,

71
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,362
I truly believe, in his mind,
he knew what it was gonna be like

72
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,782
when Forrest would break free
and run from those braces.

73
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,534
And every little moment,

74
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,411
which is amazing
about working with Bob is,

75
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,872
I really think he sees
what he's going to do today,

76
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,083
and knows where it's gonna come out
in the future.

77
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:01,297
Oak Alley is a wonderful place,

78
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,174
that we kind of all fell in love
with the South.

79
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,344
I remember when we were driving
around looking for different places,

80
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,762
it was very important

81
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,058
that the trees kind of made you feel,
with that Spanish moss,

82
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,601
of right away
you know you're in the South,

83
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,144
right away you know
you're in a place of heritage,

84
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,647
right away you know
you're in a place of home.

85
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,400
And one of the things
that was most important to everyone,

86
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,029
and in particular to Forrest,
was his home of Alabama.

87
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,990
Throughout every incident
that he went in his life,

88
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,618
if you notice, he always came home.

89
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,120
Home was where he was safe,

90
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:36,707
and, kind of, home was where
he knew he was comfortable.

91
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,384
The other thing that Bob did,
which was very interesting,

92
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,179
was in terms of Mama, in Sally,
was she was always a lady.

93
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:55,685
No matter what she did or what situation
you put her in, she was still a lady.

94
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:59,647
You never felt that he came
from an unfortunate house,

95
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,984
or he came from a place
where he was denied anything.

96
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:09,031
You felt like he came from
a very old, wonderful Southern house.

97
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,534
And it wasn't that they were rich
or they were poor,

98
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,620
but they were just what everybody
imagines the South to be.

99
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:19,000
So right away, everybody kind of
understood where Forrest came from.

100
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,216
I think every parent has a fear
of when you sit there and you look...

101
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,969
And somebody sits there
and calls you in and says,

102
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:35,266
"How is your child doing in school?"
And what Mama had to deal with

103
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,768
was what every parent's
fear and nightmare is

104
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:42,314
that they'd have to deal with.
And the way that she kind of said,

105
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:46,444
"My son's not gonna be any different.
I don't care what you say,"

106
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,739
led the road for Forrest ahead of him.

107
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,553
Bob had a wonderful way of knowing
what was gonna be funny

108
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:17,516
and just, kind of, could hear
the audiences roar with laughter,

109
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,394
even while he was filming a scene.

110
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:26,150
And, you know, it was amazing to have
somebody around who just knew...

111
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,988
I've never in my life, nor ever will
in my life, work with somebody

112
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,950
who has that ability
to put his finger right on

113
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,330
what will make people laugh
and make them cry.

114
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,754
<i>Curious George</i> is a really funny,
important thing to me,

115
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:51,258
'cause one day Eric was writing
the scene of Mama reading to Forrest,

116
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,636
and he said, "God, Wendy, I don't know.
What book should that be?"

117
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,347
And I remember running upstairs
to my daughter's bookcase

118
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,059
and I came across, in fact,
my old copy of <i>Curious George,</i>

119
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:04,647
and I ran back to Eric, and I said to him,
<i>"Curious George, Curious George."</i>

120
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,941
And we said,
"God, yeah, that makes sense."

121
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,068
And I always chuckle, personally,

122
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,239
at that notion of, there Forrest is
getting <i>Curious George</i> read to him

123
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,741
in the way that I read to my kids,
and by the way,

124
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:20,079
the way that everybody, I think,
across the world reads to their kids.

125
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,295
The boarding house
was a labour of love.

126
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,467
Rick Carter took it so seriously,
as he does with all of his work,

127
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:38,305
to make it authentic and real
and not movie over-the-top,

128
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,850
the way that you see in some movies.
That you see people

129
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,853
live well beyond their means
of who their characters would be.

130
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,479
Everything that was created
in this house

131
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,982
was to make it look like
it was authentic and real.

132
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,860
If you notice,
there's nothing overly lavish.

133
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,279
These are people who have
a nice, old Southern home,

134
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,447
but obviously anything
that was truly valuable

135
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,617
from the future
has been long gone or long sold.

136
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,509
Once Elvis came into the picture,

137
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,889
and Forrest learnt how to dance
and put two and two together,

138
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,099
I think the audience is well-aware

139
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:25,269
that they were on the road
to somewhere very, very special.

140
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,491
Michael Conner was an amazing find
of Ellen Lewis',

141
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,035
the young Forrest Gump.

142
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,870
We looked forever
and forever and forever.

143
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,246
We had searches
throughout the country.

144
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,916
We must have gone through
10,000 different faces,

145
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,962
and once we met him,
we knew he was it.

146
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,964
He had never been on a plane

147
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,800
when he flew out here
for the screen test.

148
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,010
He'd never really acted.

149
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,846
He only had directed
his own home movies.

150
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,475
And he had
a sense of innocence about him

151
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,937
that you know
that Forrest of youth would have had.

152
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,541
This is another special moment
for me, too.

153
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,586
The bus driver
bears my daughter's name,

154
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:39,718
and it was great how we meet her
in the 1950s,

155
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,431
and as all of you know,
we will see her again later.

156
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,225
And Bob has those little touches

157
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:51,522
of just making everybody kind of feel
comfortable in a very small-town way.

158
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,486
He also has a way
of picking out moments

159
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,946
that we all feel that we've been through.

160
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,074
I think everybody as a child
knows that one moment.

161
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,826
Where do you sit?

162
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,705
"Are people looking at me?
Am I the geek? Am I the nerd?"

163
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:12,751
And he has a way of capturing it,
in a way,

164
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,171
that you both have empathy
for the character,

165
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,091
and you also could have imagined,

166
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,927
"Oh, my God,
those were moments in my life,"

167
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,014
or, "They actually really were
moments in my life."

168
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,267
I remember this bus scene, 'cause we
were filming down there in the South,

169
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,563
and it was in August
and it was as hot as hot could be,

170
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,316
with more mosquitoes per square inch
than there ever lived.

171
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,569
And these little kids spent two days
driving back and forth

172
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,195
on this dirt road in the bus,

173
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,910
and the way they looked
is nothing compared to the way they felt.

174
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,670
One of the keys
to the beauty of <i>Forrest Gump</i>

175
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,922
is Forrest's love for Jenny.

176
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,719
From that moment, where that little girl
offered him a seat next to her,

177
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,972
a love affair of life took off.

178
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,731
They had a way of talking
with each other

179
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,776
and they had a truth
and they had an honesty.

180
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,906
And I think one of the main points
of the movie is unrequited love.

181
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,370
And I think that, from the second
that Forrest laid eyes on Jenny,

182
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,125
the whole movie took a turn
of his love story with Jenny.

183
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,355
Jenny, like Mama,
never looked at Forrest any differently,

184
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,485
and I don't know if that's the real reason
that he loved her,

185
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:06,490
or the reason that, in some ways,
she was a lost soul like he was.

186
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:57,833
One of the keys to finding Jenny
was who, as with Tom,

187
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,754
could number one, age 20 years,

188
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:08,552
basically go from high school
through mid-adult.

189
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,346
That was number one, really important,

190
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:17,269
because both of those characters had
to be able to play 16 all the way to 36.

191
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,272
One of the other things
was the chemistry

192
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,358
between the two of them,
because it is such a love story,

193
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:27,529
that what Bob insisted on,
and I think he was so brilliant about it,

194
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,991
was that we screen-test
whoever these two people would be,

195
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,578
so you really could tell
if there was magic between them.

196
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,664
And it's probably been one
of my greatest lessons in filmmaking,

197
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:41,210
and something that I truly now
do try to insist on,

198
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,086
if I ever can have it be possible is,

199
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,924
if somebody really, really wants
to play a part, they will screen-test for it.

200
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,718
And in fact, as you know,
and you'll see in the DVD,

201
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,262
that this is what Robin Wright did.

202
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:56,433
I also think that Robin kind of
had the look so much of a Jenny.

203
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,021
You knew
that she carried stories within her

204
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,734
that weren't quite always easy to tell
that she wore.

205
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,086
One of the fun parts for me, personally,
with Forrest, is that I'm a runner.

206
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,213
So, I could understand often
when he was going somewhere,

207
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,006
and how he was going, how he felt.

208
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,843
Not that I run like this,
or the wind, as Forrest would say,

209
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:36,848
but there's a great freedom
in, kind of, being out there and running,

210
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,433
and there's, kind of,
a great piece of mind.

211
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,395
And you kind of felt like wherever
he was running, he would feel that.

212
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:46,108
He would just run through anything
and it would, kind of, not even faze him.

213
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:07,337
It's also funny for us to look at today,
'cause children today have no idea

214
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,673
that you run or ride a bicycle
to somebody's house.

215
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,675
It's unheard of that...

216
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,679
In the South,
you would walk to somebody's house

217
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,723
and nobody would be scared.
You'd probably still do it today,

218
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,350
but in a lot of the big cities
that we all live in,

219
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:24,313
kids don't run around
and don't have the freedom that they do.

220
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,781
This scene of Jenny
being chased by her father

221
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,953
kind of led us all
to understand Jenny's pain,

222
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:44,207
and one of the reasons
why she probably fled a lot

223
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,419
throughout the rest of the movie.

224
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,883
Bob had an amazing way
of telling the story of her abuse

225
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,219
without getting graphic.

226
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,902
And, kind of, the birds were what
made us think of Jenny from then on,

227
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,237
and I remember
when Bob created those birds,

228
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,366
or rather Ken Ralston did,
digitally, for Bob.

229
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:21,411
They, kind of,
were a foreshadowing of Jenny's story.

230
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,540
Birds always go away,
but they always come home.

231
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,804
Just in the same way
that Forrest would run to Jenny's,

232
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,889
it was always wonderful for me,
with this scene,

233
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,767
that Jenny would come
to Forrest's house.

234
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,859
This scene's wonderful,
when they're lying in bed together,

235
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,070
'cause he gives her that little look
that you know

236
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,031
that he's, kind of,
growing up to be a man.

237
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,284
What was great in this transition

238
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,621
was we just went
from young Jenny and young Forrest

239
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,166
to older Jenny and older Forrest,

240
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,795
and we did it with such ease
that you never even noticed

241
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,841
that these two characters
had aged 10 years.

242
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,020
One of the other things that Forrest...
We all chuckled at,

243
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,939
and it actually was established
in the book,

244
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:17,778
was his sense of being
at a certain place, at a certain time

245
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,363
where something miraculous happened.

246
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,116
And when he gets discovered
by 'Bear' Bryant in this scene,

247
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,496
it is just, kind of, the chuckle
that leads us on his journey

248
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:31,082
of a lot of historic events
and a lot of famous people.

249
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,475
And what also was so great

250
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,436
is how the running was tied into
a lot of the things that Forrest does,

251
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,898
and it kind of gave him a special talent

252
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,777
that carried him through Alabama,
through Vietnam,

253
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,864
through, you know,
a cross-country marathon.

254
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,752
From a physical standpoint,
it was amazing what Bob did with this,

255
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,840
because this is... You have seen...

256
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,843
We're filming in a local stadium,

257
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,930
and all of those people, basically,
were computer-generated.

258
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,100
They were moved around and multiplied,

259
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,020
and you got the feeling
that you were in the Orange Bowl,

260
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,731
or wherever the classic would've been.

261
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,754
The amazing part about Forrest
in the Wallace scene

262
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,673
was we all knew he was not feeling

263
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,885
what the Southerners there
were feeling.

264
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,219
We know that he had no judgement

265
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,222
about going to school
with African-Americans.

266
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,557
We know he really didn't care.

267
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,644
He just was darn curious
of what all the commotion was about.

268
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,437
And by him being there,

269
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,190
he was able to touch
a little bit of history,

270
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,734
because when she dropped that book,

271
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,071
there was no other Southern student
who was gonna go up and pick it up

272
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,156
other than Forrest Gump.

273
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,673
One of the things that was so hard
in getting <i>Forrest Gump</i> made,

274
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,174
for the nine years
that it was in development,

275
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,635
was everybody thought
it was very episodic,

276
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,764
that it was not a story
with a traditional three-act structure.

277
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:19,352
And you kind of went from one episode
to another episode to another episode,

278
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,814
and what tied you all together
was this unbelievable character.

279
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,692
But yet, it was not presented
in the traditional way

280
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,902
that most movie stories are,

281
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,821
and ultimately, that was the thing

282
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,699
that people really, kind of,
grasped onto and loved,

283
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:36,327
is because they, kind of,
were just waiting every time to see

284
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,414
where Forrest would go
and where the story would take you.

285
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:46,046
And they never had any idea
of what was ahead or what was in store.

286
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:57,599
Forrest, in a lot of ways,
always came to Jenny's rescue.

287
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,935
And unfortunately,
often for his own benefit,

288
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,814
he didn't know what he was doing
or what situation he was in.

289
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,652
And she often was his reason.

290
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,406
She would try to make him
understand situations

291
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,909
of which he really wasn't capable.

292
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:42,977
Even with how mad she is at him
in this scene for ruining her date,

293
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:49,317
you know she can't help herself
but really loving this man.

294
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,913
One of the other
really, really wonderful things

295
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,874
that came to life when the movie
was made was the music.

296
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:09,295
Joel Sill chose so many songs,

297
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,423
that the moment that you would hear
a couple notes in the tune,

298
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,675
you'd know exactly where you are,

299
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,136
and it would set you in a time
and set you in a place.

300
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:20,431
And he did it in a way
that was very natural and not directed.

301
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,795
Bob also had a way,
at the end of any scene,

302
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:18,258
of cutting to something that would put,
like, a real little touch on it

303
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,718
that you didn't quite expect.

304
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:37,485
Just like the football players
falling on each other.

305
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,956
When Forrest and the president
shook hands for the first time,

306
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,086
it was an amazing moment for people.
I remember seeing audiences just gasp.

307
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,297
I remember seeing friends
see a clip of it,

308
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,342
just couldn't believe it would happen.
And it was something that, I think,

309
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,469
none of us
really quite realised the effect on,

310
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:48,514
'cause we had all been witness
to the preparation of it so much.

311
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,934
But it was truly one of the most
memorable moments in cinema,

312
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:56,522
because we really took
one of our most famous American icons

313
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,900
and had him meet Forrest Gump.

314
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,793
Some of the points of history
that we were taken through,

315
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,545
unfortunately, they would have
humorous moments with Forrest,

316
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,881
and then often
there would be a very sad button.

317
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,801
Whether it be George Wallace,
the Kennedys,

318
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,303
and other future moments.

319
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,014
But we kind of realised that that was
the period of time through the '60s,

320
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,893
that we made great strides
but there was also great sadness.

321
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,454
What's neat about
the bus scene to Vietnam is,

322
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:57,667
obviously, it mirrors the bus scene
when Forrest first went off to school,

323
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,170
and you kind of know,
from his friendship with Jenny,

324
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:04,215
that the moment he sits down
next to Bubba,

325
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,678
that will be his best friend,
just as Jenny is his best girl.

326
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,282
In the way that you knew that Jenny
had her past and her damages,

327
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,784
that she was in some ways
a damaged soul,

328
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:35,997
it was kind of similar to the way
that Bubba looked at the world

329
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,207
in a little bit different way
than most people,

330
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,460
and kind of in the same way
that Forrest looked at it.

331
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,628
Just a little bit cockeyed.

332
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,125
I think, for all of us, after all
of the shrimp through filming this movie,

333
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:25,588
and by the way, also being down
in Beaufort, South Carolina, living there,

334
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,673
which is a shrimping area itself,

335
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,343
I think that all of us
have had our shrimp,

336
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,887
probably for the rest of our life.

337
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:52,573
Once again, what made Forrest
so extraordinary in the military

338
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:55,993
was because
he just, kind of, did what he was told.

339
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:00,248
He didn't get distracted
in the way that often people,

340
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:05,169
let's put it this way, a higher intelligence
or larger capacity for life would have,

341
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:09,507
and I think that's what made him
such an extraordinary soldier.

342
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,124
Any of those simple tasks
that Forrest had,

343
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,127
he was just extraordinary at,
and I think that that was,

344
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,588
kind of, also the fun of showing him
to everybody in the world,

345
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,840
'cause I think everybody hopefully thinks

346
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,593
that there's one little thing
that they're extraordinary at,

347
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,636
and if you can find that one thing
you're extraordinary at,

348
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,763
you kind of know
what makes you feel good

349
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:01,767
and kind of understand where
everybody was rooting for Forrest.

350
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,155
There were moments in this movie

351
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,950
that none of us could foreshadow
what audiences would think,

352
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,369
and to hear everybody just roar

353
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,791
when Bubba cited
his thousands of shrimp recipes

354
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,589
was one of surprise and, I guess, glee.

355
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,722
The other thing is,
whenever there was a quiet moment,

356
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,059
you always knew
that Forrest was thinking of Jenny.

357
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,479
And I think, in some ways,
it comforted everyone to know

358
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:51,567
that he was not so lonely and sad,
but yet, he was always thinking of her.

359
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,828
And it was always important
that wherever you are in the movie,

360
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:05,206
you kind of had a feeling
of where Jenny was.

361
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:10,753
And the decision was conscious
to always not let too much time go by

362
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,048
without us realising where Jenny was,
what she was doing.

363
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:18,594
And also, at times, she supplied for us,
kind of, a benchmark in history

364
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,223
of what was happening
and what was changing.

365
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,209
At this point in the movie,
we're seeing Jenny and Forrest

366
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,002
go in two separate directions.

367
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:56,507
She, obviously, is becoming
a lot more anti-Vietnam.

368
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,135
He's on his way to Vietnam.

369
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:05,266
We both know that the future for them
together does not look great,

370
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:10,563
but once again, there he is, he sees her,
he's gonna notice her in distress,

371
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,941
and like her Prince Charming,
he comes to save her.

372
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,987
He always seemed to show up
at the perfect moment,

373
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,991
save her, and then yet, once again,

374
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:08,329
she'd always forgive him and, kind of,
be thankful that he was there.

375
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,627
But this time, when she knew
he was leaving, she was scared,

376
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,004
'cause I think everybody knew
what it meant

377
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,340
when you're going to Vietnam.

378
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:10,266
Robin Wright, in her portrayal,
she really often...

379
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,018
It's just seeing her and looking at her,

380
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:17,064
and you understand the time and place
of where she is and what she's doing.

381
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,568
And one of the things that great efforts
went into were her hairstyles,

382
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,779
if you look at them.
You know, she had numerous wigs.

383
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:26,198
Her hair went from long to short,

384
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:30,077
from a hippie to trying to be
a good Southern mother.

385
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,122
And little things
like touches of hairstyles,

386
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,833
it's amazing the effect they can have.

387
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,337
When we all sat down
and started talking about

388
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,964
who would be the perfect Mama,
it was funny,

389
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:27,468
Tom and I both came to,
kind of, the same conclusion,

390
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,763
that there was nobody better than Sally,

391
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:36,560
and we just saw that she was
what Mama Gump would be,

392
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,480
and she kind of is
what Mama Gump would be.

393
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:16,976
Lieutenant Dan's character
was just so out there.

394
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,521
We had a real difficulty thinking about

395
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,147
who would be
the perfect Lieutenant Dan,

396
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:25,859
and when Gary Sinise
walked into the room at Bob's office

397
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:27,194
and read the lines,

398
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,947
I remember everybody
just turned to themselves and said,

399
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,032
"Oh, my God, he's here."

400
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,451
And what was wonderful
about Gary was...

401
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:40,582
Gary is such a well-trained actor,
and he had never...

402
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:45,129
None of us would ever think of him
as being particularly funny,

403
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:49,049
and there were just comments
that came out of him,

404
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,677
like, the first time
we set our eyes on him in this scene,

405
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,096
that were absolutely hysterical.

406
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:55,949
It's amazing to look at the whole place
and know that

407
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,912
this was, again, a wetland side
of a marshy side of South Carolina

408
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:04,166
that probably was only about 40 minutes
from Mama's house.

409
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:09,213
And so much was done,
in terms of visual effects,

410
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,007
that will never be known to the viewer.

411
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,886
Mountains that were put in backgrounds.

412
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,175
The boys all went
into real military training

413
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:39,970
with Lieutenant Dale Dye,
who is a military expert,

414
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:44,349
and Parris Island
is a very famous marine base,

415
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,602
which was in the same locale

416
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:49,479
as where we were
shooting this movie, so...

417
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:56,111
We went one day and hung out
at a Marine shooting base

418
00:44:56,195 --> 00:45:00,407
where everybody
truly did shoot real M16s

419
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:04,786
and stood and worked out
with real marines,

420
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:11,543
and everything, kind of, was done
so the actors could get a taste of reality,

421
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,503
so when they went to go portray it,

422
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:17,049
they really were in the mindset
of what was authentic.

423
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:58,799
When we cast all of these boys,

424
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:03,345
I think it was really important
that they were a little bit of everymen,

425
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,181
because I think that that's what,
for the most part,

426
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:08,892
our troops in Vietnam were made up of.

427
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,273
A cross-section
of the typical American boys

428
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,358
from all over the country.

429
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,004
Just as you're having a yearning
for what's going on back home,

430
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,882
the story comes and gives you
kind of what you would like.

431
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:25,594
And I think that's where a lot of people
found great peace in <i>Forrest Gump,</i>

432
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,680
because everything
that you were expecting back home

433
00:47:28,764 --> 00:47:30,265
was not what you'd expect,

434
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,353
but still, it was answering questions
of what you were wondering.

435
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,527
One of the few things
that was taken from the book

436
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:45,197
was Forrest's friendship with Bubba.

437
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:49,910
Bubba, in the book, very much
like in the movie, in the script,

438
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:52,829
was truly Forrest's best friend.

439
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,707
He was the only person
who knew and understood Forrest,

440
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,042
and Forrest was the only person

441
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,877
who could probably know
and understand Bubba.

442
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,631
And what was also so important,
I think, to the story was,

443
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:07,427
what Bubba gave Forrest
was shrimping.

444
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,262
And probably one of the things

445
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,432
that Jenny helped encourage
with Forrest was running,

446
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:15,602
so both of these two key characters
in his life

447
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:17,813
were able to supply him with, probably,

448
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,316
two of the most necessary things
he had for surviving

449
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,986
in all the different situations that he did.

450
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,585
What was great with Jenny
was she let us have a little notion

451
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:44,297
of everything that was happening
during the '60s and the early '70s.

452
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,716
With just one little look at her,
one little glimpse,

453
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,176
you know exactly where she was going,

454
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,679
what she was doing,
what challenge she had,

455
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:54,057
and you could place her
in the time and the moment.

456
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,454
The filming of this sequence
was terrifying.

457
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:20,041
First of all, because it was so real.
You had the feeling of...

458
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,836
It was a combination
of days and days and days work,

459
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:26,548
but every little episode
that was constructed

460
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:29,509
and then to lay on each other was real.

461
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:34,473
It was intense,
and I remember watching Tom

462
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:40,687
carry all these bodies back and forth
and back and forth and back and forth,

463
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:44,316
and you knew they were actors,
and you knew it was makeup,

464
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:47,068
but somehow you knew
what it all meant.

465
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,187
No matter how crazy and intense
Lieutenant Dan was,

466
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,190
you really did know
he cared about his boys,

467
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,360
and you really did feel that he had
a true sense of responsibility for them,

468
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,904
and he understood
that both Forrest and Bubba

469
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:35,492
were probably a little more limited
in intelligence than some of his men.

470
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,915
For someone who people thought
had such a limited sense of intelligence,

471
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:30,714
Forrest was terribly devoted
and terribly responsible.

472
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:37,846
And I think everybody's heart sank

473
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,682
when he knew
that Bubba wasn't with him,

474
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,852
and he knew that Bubba
was probably in trouble.

475
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,342
The moment that Forrest finds Bubba

476
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,013
is probably
the largest moment of growth

477
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:28,433
that he's had in his life
up until this very moment.

478
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:34,439
And I think this is truly the moment
that he's become a man,

479
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:43,740
when I think he's witnessed loss
right before him.

480
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:43,925
And for me,
from the moment you read the script

481
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:47,470
to the moment
that Bubba is in his arms,

482
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:51,766
the word "home" is the kind of thing
that resonates with me to this day.

483
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,935
Just, "I want to go home."

484
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:17,709
It's also the first time
that we see Forrest's real pain

485
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,504
and his real loss.

486
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:32,640
When you come back to him this time,

487
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:37,145
and I think he's a different man than
he's ever been on the bench before.

488
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:04,172
Just as reality would really sink in,

489
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,257
Forrest Gump
would always do something

490
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,885
that was so absurd or being so crazy

491
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:12,597
that got you back
into the notion of the fun of the movie.

492
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,458
I think for everybody
who was on the set that day,

493
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:45,672
when Lieutenant Dan
was picked up without any legs,

494
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:48,508
even though we could see them
with the blue screen that was there,

495
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:51,511
was truly gasping,
because it was the first time,

496
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,930
as in many scenes in this movie,

497
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,850
that somebody had truly lost their legs.

498
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:10,613
And once again, just as he
was getting on the road to happiness,

499
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:13,783
he unfortunately
had to suffer a disappointment.

500
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,845
Ping-Pong is one of the fun things
that was also there in the book

501
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,972
that we altered slightly.

502
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:54,782
What's also fun is,
Forrest became good at things

503
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,910
that were just everyday things
to most people.

504
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:01,664
Nobody would ever think of being
a professional Ping-Pong player,

505
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:05,960
or where that would lead you,
which we all know where it led him to.

506
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:09,964
But, "Just keep the ball and watch,"
and there he went.

507
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:38,409
This stuff was really fun, because all
of the special effects stuff that we did...

508
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:41,204
Still, Tom had to become
a fairly good Ping-Pong player

509
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,789
to make it look
that it could be believable

510
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:45,374
that a ball would bounce like that.

511
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,905
Destiny is a very important part
of the whole movie.

512
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:01,325
Every character in the movie
has his or her destiny,

513
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:04,787
and Lieutenant Dan is the voice
for all of us as the audience,

514
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:08,332
because he's the only one who really
does acknowledge what destiny is

515
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:12,086
and what destiny's significance
is in everybody's journey.

516
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:18,467
I think it was a very conscious moment
of Eric Roth's

517
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,928
to include that destiny in there.

518
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:58,901
What was great was that Forrest
went back to the White House again,

519
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:02,196
and so many times in his life
he did things again.

520
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:41,861
Washington was a wonderful place
to shoot. It was amazing.

521
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,947
Wherever you were, you looked around

522
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:50,244
and just couldn't believe that you were
in front of the Washington Memorial,

523
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:54,540
the Lincoln Memorial, the White House.

524
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:59,754
It was truly, probably, one of the most
fun that we had for those 10 days.

525
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,352
We shot in front
of the Washington Memorial.

526
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:18,981
It was one of the coldest days
in November

527
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:21,734
that they had ever had in Washington.
And, in fact, we were on the news,

528
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:25,404
because we were recreating a day
that was quite warm,

529
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:29,367
and people were dressed very casually,
and with limited layers.

530
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,620
And it truly was, I think, in the 20s,

531
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:38,125
and we had people in flimsy
peasant dresses and sandals.

532
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:43,297
And every time we'd yell, "Cut,"
they'd be going to a hot soup line.

533
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:57,436
I think the other part that's really fun
is people like Abbie Hoffman.

534
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,064
A lot of people's children
would have no idea who he was,

535
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:05,820
and I think that Forrest was able
to educate people with important,

536
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:08,572
as I've said before, icons of history,

537
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:11,075
that you look at Abbie Hoffman
and exactly know

538
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:12,743
what the sentiment was
and what the feeling was

539
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:15,538
at that exact time in that exact place.

540
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:40,396
Washington's also a city
that's very difficult to shoot in.

541
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,526
You're restricted about
where you can put cameras,

542
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:48,863
where you can sit,
where you can have a truck,

543
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:53,659
so it made all the filming there
terribly difficult.

544
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,632
We had a hard time thinking
of what Forrest would say

545
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,342
about the war in Vietnam,

546
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:13,554
and we really couldn't figure out
what his perfect words would be,

547
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,306
and the idea kind of came in

548
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:20,311
to have the police stop
whatever his message would be,

549
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,438
'cause we never quite figured out
what words he would use

550
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:24,857
to describe the war in Vietnam.

551
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:31,322
By the time he started talking again,

552
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:33,824
you know it was something brilliant
that he must've said,

553
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:36,911
even though none of us had heard
what it was.

554
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,410
What also was so wonderful

555
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:20,829
is how Forrest Gump and Jenny
would meet all over the world together.

556
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:22,331
Nobody ever questioned it.

557
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,376
They were just so happy
to see them together.

558
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:36,971
The two days that we filmed there,
the skies were very different.

559
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:39,473
One day was cloudy
and one was very clear,

560
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:42,560
and Bob computer-generated
the skies to match.

561
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:27,521
Every single role was meticulously cast.

562
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,441
Yeah, there were constantly
pictures of references

563
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:33,110
of what members
of the Panthers looked like,

564
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,196
so we could figure out
where there would be a resemblance.

565
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,450
It was very important
that everybody be realistic

566
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:43,954
and everybody be authentic. Obviously,
you know, it could not be identical,

567
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:48,125
but often if you were to take pictures
from who the group really was

568
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,085
and put it up against who were cast,

569
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,921
it would be astounding
how close we came.

570
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:27,414
Also what was great about Forrest is,
he was rarely violent.

571
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:32,503
The only time he really ever
would lift a fist was in defence of Jenny.

572
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,797
I think what's difficult
for people at this time

573
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,259
is that they're knowing that Forrest's
character actually has grown,

574
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:23,846
and Jenny's character is so lost

575
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:27,182
that she's not really going anywhere
with her life.

576
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,971
Bob had a love of William Castle,

577
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,265
and for me, in particular,
this scene was so much fun

578
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,893
because if you look, <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>
is playing across the street

579
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,811
at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre.

580
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,314
And we actually went
to a friend of mine's,

581
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:17,065
who happens to be
Bill Castle's daughter,

582
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:19,735
and we got a copy of the real poster

583
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,905
so we could have
the authentic poster up on top.

584
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:47,763
We don't quite believe him,

585
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:51,850
and this wonderful look
that Forrest gives lets us know as well.

586
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:15,415
One of the other things in the movie
the whole entire time

587
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,376
is that there's this Jenny scene
that goes on,

588
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:20,254
this wonderful score
that Alan Silvestri wrote,

589
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:24,383
and it kind of always takes you back
to our feeling

590
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,094
of the love that the two of them had.

591
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:31,598
And all you need to do
is hear the first couple of those notes

592
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:34,184
and you know exactly where you are.

593
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,957
The other fun part about the two of them

594
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,208
was you always knew
that at some point,

595
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:02,963
they'd be back together again soon.
You kind of couldn't wait for it to come.

596
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:12,014
And so much is always said
with just a look.

597
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:56,099
What's amazing to look at,
when you look at the movie,

598
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,937
is how many important things
have happened in that span of years.

599
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,941
I mean, our country was at a point
where there were so many changes.

600
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,193
And another funny thing
during this scene was,

601
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,778
when we filmed this scene,

602
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:12,032
by accident, we had had
the flag of China upside-down

603
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:15,619
and when we were fixing other things
in terms of doing the special effects,

604
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:19,831
we put the stars in the right order,
right-side up.

605
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,706
Right at that moment
people knew where you were going,

606
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:02,916
and they just couldn't wait.

607
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,536
Surprise of this scene,
which is supposed to be New York City,

608
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:42,039
was shot in downtown Los Angeles.

609
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,852
Gary really did a lot of research
into what a man with no legs,

610
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,980
who was unfortunately a drunk,
a Vietnam vet, would be like,

611
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,108
and I remember him walking through...

612
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,818
Well, we're soon
to get to his apartment,

613
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:56,738
and wondering what pictures
he would have, and he truly

614
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:03,161
put himself in the mind and the place
of a man in that situation.

615
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:14,881
I think often we're reminded
about the pain of the war

616
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:18,218
and the pain of the times,
without saying anything.

617
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:05,617
Forrest always had a way
of being on a path to go somewhere

618
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,662
and either bumping into Jenny
or Lieutenant Dan on that way,

619
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:11,623
and somehow he would get back
on that path.

620
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:20,674
And in most of the cases,
he was carrying on somebody's destiny.

621
01:20:01,756 --> 01:20:03,967
Even at their most dislikeable moments,

622
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,678
characters like Gary
were still totally endearing,

623
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:09,389
'cause you know that Forrest
would somehow lead them

624
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:12,392
in the right way
at some point in the story.

625
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:16,247
It's only 1972, and I think everybody
who's been with us since the beginning

626
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,875
feels like it's been 30 or 40 years.

627
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:26,424
And every moment's, kind of, touched
with such bittersweet.

628
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:04,063
Looking back at this scene,
I think the audience is so emotionally

629
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:10,153
moved by Lieutenant Dan,

630
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:14,782
but I think they also were equally
staggered visually by his lack of limbs.

631
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:44,307
As Forrest left the military,
I think the movie took a different turn,

632
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,852
'cause it was less reflecting
about the sadness and the grieving

633
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:51,856
of the Vietnam War,
and became about other things.

634
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:10,708
And once he came home,
he really had to learn his own way,

635
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:14,837
because he had nobody or no general
or no sergeant or no military

636
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:17,256
telling him what to do any more.

637
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,474
You notice Bob even had
the little touches of Forrest

638
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:29,769
whenever he took his picture
with his eyes closed.

639
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:15,231
We had a wonderful gospel group
that was local,

640
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:18,609
that we used for all
of these background songs.

641
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:45,428
The sadness of the movie
for the most part, I think, is lifted

642
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:49,182
once he gets home and you know
he's following Bubba's wish.

643
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,175
I think at some point Forrest is happy,

644
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:27,345
'cause I think he thinks
he's with Bubba again.

645
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:31,474
And I think all of us in the audience
kind of felt that as well.

646
01:28:33,059 --> 01:28:35,603
And for the first time ever,
he's really kind of become a man

647
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:40,066
with his own journey,
even though it's not so fortuitous

648
01:28:41,484 --> 01:28:46,572
in what his fishing accomplishments
are going to be, as of yet.

649
01:31:18,224 --> 01:31:20,643
To me, this is one of the most
comforting scenes in the whole movie,

650
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:22,645
'cause you know that moon
is the moon that they share,

651
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:26,482
and therefore Jenny and Forrest
will be together again soon.

652
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:09,859
I think people have fun,
because they always knew

653
01:32:11,235 --> 01:32:15,906
that the characters in the movie had
just as much fun with Forrest as we are.

654
01:33:51,961 --> 01:33:55,756
This Randy Newman song
kind of adds to the fun of the moment.

655
01:35:08,621 --> 01:35:10,539
The filmmaking behind this
was extraordinary.

656
01:35:10,623 --> 01:35:15,044
They literally brought in jet engines
to simulate the wind

657
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:18,797
and blow the rain around
like a real hurricane.

658
01:35:39,652 --> 01:35:41,278
No matter what kind of situation
we got in,

659
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:43,364
no matter how extraordinary it was,

660
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:46,075
we had no idea
where it was gonna lead us,

661
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:49,620
and I think that nobody
during this hurricane knew

662
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:53,165
that Forrest was going
to come out of it a millionaire.

663
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,458
We had no idea
that Bubba Gump Shrimp

664
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:41,088
would become the sensation that it did,
that even after the movie came out,

665
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:44,049
we got demands from Paramount
to mass-produce more hats

666
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:46,343
that they quickly sold
throughout the country.

667
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:49,930
And in retrospect,
none of us even would have imagined

668
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:52,975
that there'd be the demand
for a Bubba Gump Shrimp hat.

669
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:55,269
I wish we'd known beforehand.

670
01:37:13,454 --> 01:37:16,582
Nora Dunfee was a wonderful actress

671
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:18,876
who Ellen Lewis found for us
from New York.

672
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:23,088
She was a very famous acting teacher,
and she just was spectacular.

673
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:05,881
Once again,
Lieutenant Dan jumping overboard,

674
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,802
I think, is an homage to Eric's theme
of destiny in the movie.

675
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:14,681
And you're gonna be taken
wherever you're taken.

676
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:37,037
I think once after Bubba died,
Lieutenant Dan,

677
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:39,456
when he came back into his life,

678
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:44,253
did become his best friend.

679
01:38:58,308 --> 01:39:00,227
Little touches throughout the movie
that if you notice now,

680
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:04,106
there are more mailboxes on this road
than there were before.

681
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:25,252
So you notice Forrest wore
a blue shirt and khaki pants

682
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:29,047
through a lot of the movie,
when he was a young boy,

683
01:39:29,131 --> 01:39:31,216
and it was always buttoned up,
until the end of the movie

684
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,594
when you notice
Forrest had grown a little bit

685
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:35,596
and had unbuttoned his shirt button.

686
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,055
And that was
a conscious choice of Bob's

687
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:39,766
to show us
how his character had grown.

688
01:39:51,445 --> 01:39:53,822
I think all of us have a gasp in our throat

689
01:39:53,906 --> 01:39:56,992
knowing that this is when
Sally's going to be leaving Forrest,

690
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,410
but we all feel
a little bit more comfortable,

691
01:39:58,494 --> 01:40:00,829
'cause we've seen how he's grown
as a person.

692
01:40:00,913 --> 01:40:03,248
But such a little bit of Sally
goes such a long way,

693
01:40:03,332 --> 01:40:07,127
and you kind of know that
her words will be with him forever.

694
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,496
This was a very funny little moment,

695
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,875
when we came up with the idea
of the fruit company,

696
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:12,461
because that little icon
let everybody in the world know,

697
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:15,297
"Oh, my God,
he's taken care of forever."

698
01:43:01,176 --> 01:43:03,553
The little Snapper lawnmower
was a very important thing to Bob,

699
01:43:03,637 --> 01:43:09,726
that he found that exact right model
that he remembered from the early '70s.

700
01:43:50,392 --> 01:43:54,479
It also is important, no matter how much
the rest of the world changed,

701
01:43:54,563 --> 01:43:57,232
Alabama stayed the same.
Every time you went back to that house

702
01:43:57,315 --> 01:44:01,236
and every time you went back
to the room, they always were the same.

703
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:05,240
So you got a feeling that at least
Alabama was peaceful and tranquil,

704
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:09,494
even though the rest of the world
was going through so much turmoil.

705
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,980
And we're not sure even if it's real.

706
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:47,282
For the first time ever, we kind of feel
that Forrest has become a man,

707
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,203
because of his loss
and because of his growth.

708
01:45:04,508 --> 01:45:08,428
And you know Jenny's kind of survived
the turmoil that she's been through,

709
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:12,224
and we think, finally,
this couple really may have a chance.

710
01:45:52,931 --> 01:45:55,433
This moment you watch Jenny's face,

711
01:45:55,517 --> 01:45:57,227
and you see all the pain
that she's been through,

712
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:00,939
and, unfortunately,
all the poor decisions that she's made

713
01:46:01,565 --> 01:46:03,984
really come back to her childhood.

714
01:47:00,415 --> 01:47:04,085
I think what Forrest says now
is as poignant as his mother saying,

715
01:47:04,169 --> 01:47:08,673
"Life is like a box of chocolates."
Because it's his view of the world.

716
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:52,342
I think that we all feel so happy
when Forrest and Jenny are together

717
01:47:52,425 --> 01:47:55,136
because we also know
that he's so happy.

718
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,556
And he so deserves it.

719
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:19,744
And right now,
we know where we are, 1976.

720
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:36,905
That ever-famous Forrest pose.

721
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:42,786
And he probably is
the smartest man living.

722
01:50:15,026 --> 01:50:16,528
Of course, one of the things
that's so wonderful,

723
01:50:16,611 --> 01:50:19,072
so many of the images
that we watch in the movie

724
01:50:19,155 --> 01:50:21,324
are images that we've seen previously,

725
01:50:21,407 --> 01:50:23,034
but we've watched
these characters grow,

726
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:27,205
and now there's different emotion,
different depth to all of them.

727
01:51:13,418 --> 01:51:15,420
And there she goes again.

728
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:05,887
I think the movie's about a lot of icons.

729
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:09,098
You look at the sneakers.
We know the Nike swag.

730
01:52:09,641 --> 01:52:11,309
We can place the time.

731
01:52:11,392 --> 01:52:13,770
And for everybody, they may have
a little bit of different meaning,

732
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:18,483
but for everybody, they know exactly
what's happening at that moment.

733
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:59,565
Tom was incredible. Tom worked out
and got into shape for Forrest,

734
01:52:59,649 --> 01:53:02,485
so when he was running,
I mean, he was in amazing shape,

735
01:53:02,568 --> 01:53:06,447
and one needed to be in that amazing
shape, I think, to age those years,

736
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:10,702
and Tom's known for his discipline
in any role that he portrays,

737
01:53:11,035 --> 01:53:15,206
but I think that this role,
where he really did have to age 20 years

738
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:20,795
and had to do it mainly with his eyes
and with his facial gestures.

739
01:53:20,878 --> 01:53:25,008
Because, if you notice,
his clothing only changes,

740
01:53:25,091 --> 01:53:28,594
because we begin the movie
and Forrest's top button's buttoned,

741
01:53:28,678 --> 01:53:29,971
and by the time that we end the movie

742
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:32,390
he's no longer that little boy
whose top button's buttoned,

743
01:53:32,473 --> 01:53:35,059
but he's kind of grown into a man,
and his shirt's a little looser,

744
01:53:35,143 --> 01:53:38,646
and that kind of gives us a little bit
of insight into where he's grown.

745
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:41,065
But so much of it just came
from looking in his eyes

746
01:53:41,149 --> 01:53:44,986
and understanding
that this character truly did grow,

747
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:48,031
even with the limited intelligence
that he may have had.

748
01:53:48,114 --> 01:53:50,033
He became a man,
he became responsible,

749
01:53:50,116 --> 01:53:54,078
and he really did, kind of, figure out
what his own destiny was.

750
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:30,865
Cleverly, they had these splinter teams
that flew all over the country,

751
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:36,579
and Tom's brother often posed
as his double, just running.

752
01:56:58,346 --> 01:57:00,431
I remember the challenge
was to figure out

753
01:57:00,515 --> 01:57:02,767
how to get the happy face in.

754
01:57:04,727 --> 01:57:08,606
And a little easy move like placing
a muddy T-shirt to his face

755
01:57:09,774 --> 01:57:11,359
created history.

756
01:58:27,727 --> 01:58:29,270
And nobody questioned
what he did right now,

757
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:33,149
just as they didn't question
what he said with Abbie Hoffman.

758
01:58:34,233 --> 01:58:36,444
And they didn't question when he went

759
01:58:36,527 --> 01:58:38,738
and stayed home
after he had shrimp boats.

760
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:39,947
And they didn't question anything,

761
01:58:40,031 --> 01:58:42,116
'cause they always, kind of,
felt comfortable that Forrest,

762
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:45,119
somehow deep inside him,
knew what his own destiny was

763
01:58:45,202 --> 01:58:47,622
and what he was doing for himself.

764
01:59:20,821 --> 01:59:26,202
For me, the fun of it was the irony of,
she ended up living up on Henry Street,

765
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:29,330
and that happened to be the name
of one of my children,

766
01:59:29,413 --> 01:59:34,669
and it was just a total coincidence
that it was Henry Street,

767
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:37,338
but in fact,
two blocks from where we were filming,

768
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:39,757
there really was a Henry Street.

769
01:59:48,265 --> 01:59:51,686
And there he was,
sitting on the bus bench for so far.

770
01:59:54,563 --> 01:59:57,733
Twenty years of stories
and two hours of movie,

771
01:59:57,817 --> 02:00:01,737
and he was just a couple blocks
from where he should have been.

772
02:01:08,679 --> 02:01:12,975
And we also know, for the first time,
that Jenny's found her way,

773
02:01:13,058 --> 02:01:17,980
and we don't quite know why
until we meet their son.

774
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:35,581
None of us had any idea,
when we met little Haley Joel Osment,

775
02:01:35,664 --> 02:01:39,210
he was going to become
the actor that he is,

776
02:01:39,752 --> 02:01:43,672
and we chose him because we felt
that he was the proper mixture

777
02:01:43,964 --> 02:01:46,217
between a Jenny and a Forrest.

778
02:03:34,783 --> 02:03:37,202
I think that even though
Jenny has told us

779
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:40,831
that little Forrest
is one of the smartest in his class,

780
02:03:43,334 --> 02:03:45,336
when they move together,

781
02:03:46,712 --> 02:03:49,506
we also know
how smart his father is, too.

782
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,777
Everybody's so happy this moment,

783
02:04:52,236 --> 02:04:55,406
'cause big Forrest
finally has the woman he loves,

784
02:04:57,491 --> 02:04:58,659
a son,

785
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:05,416
he's at home
and he's joined by his best friends.

786
02:05:13,966 --> 02:05:16,343
And I think they're so happy,
'cause when the man that we met,

787
02:05:16,427 --> 02:05:19,013
everybody thought
was just a common idiot,

788
02:05:19,096 --> 02:05:21,473
and he probably turns out to be

789
02:05:26,228 --> 02:05:28,188
one of the wealthiest men alive,
not in terms of money,

790
02:05:28,272 --> 02:05:29,648
but in terms of what he's obtained

791
02:05:29,732 --> 02:05:32,693
and his goals and his family
and his friends.

792
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:27,307
You can see,
when Forrest walks in that room,

793
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:29,226
he's watching the same bed
that he lost his mother in,

794
02:07:29,309 --> 02:07:31,645
and I think he knows deep inside

795
02:07:32,312 --> 02:07:35,190
that Jenny's time is not too long.

796
02:12:33,738 --> 02:12:35,699
I think at this moment,
Forrest has finally explained to us

797
02:12:35,782 --> 02:12:38,660
the significance of the feather,

798
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:43,165
kind of, destiny,
and floating around on a breeze.

799
02:12:46,126 --> 02:12:47,752
And if you watch,

800
02:12:49,337 --> 02:12:52,382
there'll be the birds for Jenny.

801
02:13:31,296 --> 02:13:35,383
What's amazing, he's probably
become the best father in the world.

802
02:14:13,088 --> 02:14:15,298
What's most amazing to me
when I rewatch the movie

803
02:14:15,382 --> 02:14:19,844
is to watch Forrest go through
so many outrageous journeys

804
02:14:21,888 --> 02:14:25,267
and have so many challenges
and trials and tribulations,

805
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:27,894
but yet he finds such inner peace

806
02:14:29,896 --> 02:14:33,066
with himself, within his family,
within his home,

807
02:14:34,609 --> 02:14:36,361
and within his friends.

808
02:14:36,444 --> 02:14:40,156
And ultimately,
with Jenny and little Forrest.

809
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:29,456
When people think about <i>Forrest Gump,</i>
you often think about

810
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:32,500
all the funny and the hysterical
and the ironic moments

811
02:15:32,584 --> 02:15:39,382
of Forrest put into real-life situations
that we all can remember and visualise,

812
02:15:39,758 --> 02:15:44,596
and I think we often forget, at times,
the poignancy of the movie

813
02:15:45,221 --> 02:15:47,724
and how emotionally moved we are.

814
02:16:04,783 --> 02:16:08,161
When everyone was making this movie,
it was truly a labour of love.

815
02:16:08,244 --> 02:16:10,747
Every single person gave their all,

816
02:16:11,081 --> 02:16:15,418
and none of us had any idea
of the magnitude

817
02:16:16,503 --> 02:16:18,922
of the message that we were about to,

818
02:16:19,005 --> 02:16:21,508
in a collaborative way,
present to the world.

819
02:16:21,591 --> 02:16:24,636
And I think that that's when
movie-making's at its most special,

820
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:28,098
because when you just do it
for the love of what you're working on

821
02:16:28,181 --> 02:16:30,183
is when magic can happen.
