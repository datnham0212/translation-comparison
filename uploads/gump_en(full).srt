1
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,836
Hello. My name's Forrest... Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:26,693
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:33,679
I could eat about a million
and a half of these.

4
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,674
My mama always said

5
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:39,460
life was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,649
You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:53,968
Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:57,392
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,390
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:05,045
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,537
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:09,534
Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:13,525
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,526
Where they're going,

15
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,060
where they've been.

16
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:26,652
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,527
I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,027
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:39,862
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

20
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:43,018
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

21
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,528
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

22
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,892
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,121
How do those feel?

24
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,827
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:12,330
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,455
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,897
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,227
Forrest!

29
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,959
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

30
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,794
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero</i>

31
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,958
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

32
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:32,466
<i>She said we was related
to him in some way.</i>

33
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,966
<i>What he did was,</i>

34
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,466
<i>he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

35
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:40,968
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets</i>

36
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:45,468
<i>and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>

37
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:49,468
<i>They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

38
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:53,594
<i>And, anyway, that's how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.</i>

39
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,999
<i>Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me</i>

40
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,002
<i>that sometimes we all
do things that, well,</i>

41
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,502
<i>that just don't make no sense.</i>

42
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,437
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

43
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,664
All right.

44
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,671
What are y'all staring at?

45
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,171
Haven't you ever seen

46
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:23,228
a little boy with braces
on his legs before?

47
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:25,905
Don't ever let anybody

48
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:28,404
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

49
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,905
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

50
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,905
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

51
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,906
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:42,438
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:45,440
<i>about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:48,441
<i>That's in the county
of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,940
<i>Our house had been
in Mama's family</i>

56
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,065
<i>since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa</i>

57
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:56,576
<i>had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.</i>

58
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:59,006
<i>Since it was just me and Mama</i>

59
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,009
<i>and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

60
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:03,508
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

61
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:05,009
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

62
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:08,668
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

63
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:11,677
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

64
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,506
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

65
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,511
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

66
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,602
You're no different
than anybody else is.

67
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:24,344
Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?

68
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,844
You're the same
as everybody else.

69
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,845
You are no different.

70
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:33,573
Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:36,079
His I.Q. Is 75.

72
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,670
Well, we're all different,

73
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:40,009
Mr. Hancock.

74
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,680
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education</i>

75
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:49,182
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

76
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,181
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

77
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,511
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

78
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,981
Now, this is normal.

79
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,040
Forrest is right here.

80
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:05,948
The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80

81
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,744
to attend public school.

82
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,113
Mrs. Gump,

83
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:12,082
he's going to have to
go to a special school.

84
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,583
Now, he'll be just fine.

85
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:17,083
What does normal mean anyway?

86
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:19,084
He might be...

87
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:21,278
A bit on the slow side,

88
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:22,784
but my boy Forrest

89
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,786
is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

90
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,944
He's not going to
some special school

91
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,952
to learn how to retread tires.

92
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,009
We're talking about
five little points here.

93
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:37,753
There must be something
can be done.

94
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:42,277
We're a progressive
school system.

95
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,116
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

96
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:49,951
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

97
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:54,755
He's on vacation.

98
00:08:54,888 --> 00:09:00,287
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!

99
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:04,979
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

100
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,722
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

101
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,222
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

102
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,917
You don't say much, do you?

103
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:32,127
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

104
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,231
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

105
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:37,558
"Finally, he had to try.

106
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,566
"It looked easy, but...

107
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:43,226
Oh, what happened.
First they..."

108
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:46,565
Mama, what's vacation mean?

109
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:47,898
Vacation?

110
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,733
Where Daddy went?

111
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,402
Vacation's when
you go somewhere...

112
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,072
And you don't ever come back.

113
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,078
<i>Anyway, I guess you could say</i>

114
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,705
<i>me and Mama was on our own.</i>

115
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,749
<i>But we didn't mind.</i>

116
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,249
<i>Our house was never empty.</i>

117
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:15,251
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

118
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,410
Supper!

119
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,918
It's supper, everyone!

120
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:19,511
That sure looks special.

121
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:22,419
<i>Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us</i>

122
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,924
<i>that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,</i>

123
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,425
<i>folks living
out of their suitcases</i>

124
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,928
<i>and hat cases
and sample cases.</i>

125
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:35,691
Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

126
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,595
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

127
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:41,758
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

128
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:50,100
~ Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit ~

129
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,762
~ And you ain't no ~

130
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,363
~ Friend of mine ~

131
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,832
Forrest,

132
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,671
I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

133
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,176
No, that's all right, ma'am.

134
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,679
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

135
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,680
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

136
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:10,682
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

137
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,184
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.

138
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,684
Slow it down some.

139
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:18,220
~ You ain't nothing but... ~

140
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,584
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

141
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:23,249
<i>It sounded good.</i>

142
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:28,554
<i>I started moving around
to the music,</i>

143
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,559
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

144
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:32,719
~ Cryin' all the time ~

145
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,285
<i>This one night,</i>

146
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,295
<i>me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

147
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,796
<i>and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,</i>

148
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,854
<i>and guess what?</i>

149
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,335
<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>

150
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:49,461
<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>

151
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,104
<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>

152
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,073
This is not for
children's eyes.

153
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,199
<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>

154
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,708
<i>Some years later,</i>

155
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:02,711
<i>that handsome young man
who they called the King,</i>

156
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,678
<i>well, he sung too many songs.</i>

157
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:08,680
<i>Had himself a heart attack
or something.</i>

158
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:11,738
It must be hard being a king.

159
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,685
You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,

160
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:18,684
but some things you can't.

161
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,218
You do your very best now, Forrest.

162
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,688
I sure will, Mama.

163
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:28,282
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school</i>

164
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,689
<i>very well.</i>

165
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,625
Are you coming along?

166
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:38,186
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.

167
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,788
This is the bus to school.

168
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:46,064
I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.

169
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,931
I'm Dorothy Harris.

170
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,436
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.

171
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,873
This seat's taken.

172
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,744
It's taken.

173
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,742
You can't sit here.

174
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:24,989
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

175
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,387
<i>'cause I don't
remember being born.</i>

176
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,858
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

177
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:32,359
and I don't know

178
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,859
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

179
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,361
but I do remember

180
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,421
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

181
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,397
<i>in the wide world.</i>

182
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:45,401
You can sit here if you want.

183
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,603
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

184
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:54,264
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

185
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,103
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

186
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:04,234
What's wrong with your legs?

187
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,245
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

188
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,109
My legs are just fine and dandy.

189
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,114
<i>I just sat next to her
on that bus</i>

190
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:15,115
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

191
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:17,617
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

192
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,312
<i>Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me</i>

193
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,786
<i>or asked me questions.</i>

194
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:25,119
Are you stupid or something?

195
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,248
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

196
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,316
I'm Jenny.

197
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,952
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

198
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,461
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

199
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:39,088
<i>Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.</i>

200
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,097
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

201
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,657
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

202
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,395
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

203
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:50,993
"A good little..."

204
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,504
<i>She helped me
learn how to read,</i>

205
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:56,664
<i>and I showed her how to swing.</i>

206
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,240
<i>Sometimes, we'd just sit out</i>

207
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,605
<i>and wait for the stars.</i>

208
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,144
Mama's going to worry about me.

209
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:08,111
Just stay a little longer.

210
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,274
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

211
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,112
O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.

212
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:19,482
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

213
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,449
My only friend.

214
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,123
Now, my mama always told me

215
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:30,124
that miracles happen every day.

216
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,125
Some people don't think so,

217
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,683
but they do.

218
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,054
Hey, dummy!

219
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,597
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

220
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,427
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

221
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:44,830
Just run away, Forrest.

222
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,265
Run, Forrest!

223
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,426
Run away! Hurry!

224
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:51,060
Get the bikes!

225
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,933
Let's get him! Come on!

226
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,801
Look out, Gump!

227
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,737
We're going to get you!

228
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,934
Run, Forrest, run!

229
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,033
Run, Forrest!

230
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:04,967
Come back here, you!

231
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:09,240
Ha ha ha ha ha!

232
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,550
Run, Forrest!

233
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,211
Run!

234
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:56,400
<i>Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...</i>

235
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,703
but I could run
like the wind blows.

236
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,033
From that day on,

237
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,543
if I was going somewhere,

238
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,977
I was running.

239
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,165
That boy sure
is a running fool.

240
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,066
<i>Now, remember how I told you</i>

241
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:54,068
<i>that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>

242
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,501
<i>She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

243
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,199
<i>Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,</i>

244
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:04,708
<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>

245
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:06,003
Jenny?

246
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:09,009
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

247
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:13,240
<i>He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.</i>

248
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:17,014
<i>And then this one time,</i>

249
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:20,015
<i>Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.</i>

250
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,516
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

251
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:25,018
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

252
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,177
Jenny!

253
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:28,517
Come on!

254
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:31,522
Jenny, where'd you run to?

255
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,114
You better get back here, girl!

256
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,256
Where you at?

257
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:43,028
Jenny!

258
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:44,960
Jenny, where you at?

259
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,732
Jenny!

260
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,733
Pray with me, Forrest.

261
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,233
Pray with me.

262
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:53,529
Jenny!

263
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,900
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

264
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,904
far, far away from here.

265
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,907
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

266
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,908
<i>Mama always said
God is mysterious.</i>

267
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,307
Jenny!

268
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:11,310
<i>He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.</i>

269
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,141
<i>Instead,</i>

270
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:15,147
<i>he had the police say</i>

271
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:18,649
<i>Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.</i>

272
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:21,149
<i>She was to live
with her grandma,</i>

273
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:23,151
<i>just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

274
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:27,211
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

275
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,680
<i>Some nights,</i>

276
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,688
<i>Jenny'd sneak out</i>

277
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,189
<i>and come on over to my house,</i>

278
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,691
<i>just 'cause
she said she was scared.</i>

279
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,749
<i>Scared of what,
I don't know.</i>

280
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:42,489
<i>But I think
it was her grandma's dog.</i>

281
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,496
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

282
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:48,726
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends</i>

283
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,288
<i>all the way up
through high school.</i>

284
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,733
Hey, stupid!

285
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,769
Quit it!

286
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,268
Run, Forrest, run!

287
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,735
Hey,

288
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,829
didn't you hear me, stupid?

289
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:00,837
Run, Forrest!

290
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,236
Get in the truck!

291
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:05,638
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

292
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,175
Run, Forrest! Run!

293
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:12,874
Ha, ha!

294
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,140
Move it! Move it!

295
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,044
You better be runnin'!

296
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:30,519
Yeah!

297
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,250
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!

298
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,348
Run, Forrest!

299
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:42,017
Now, it used to be

300
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,029
I ran to get where I was going.

301
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:48,428
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

302
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,377
Ohh!

303
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:19,106
Who in the hell is that?

304
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,978
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

305
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,041
Just a local idiot.

306
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,484
<i>And can you believe it?</i>

307
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,349
<i>I got to go to college, too.</i>

308
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:36,490
Forrest, move it!

309
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:37,490
Run!

310
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,490
O.K.!

311
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,650
Run!

312
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:42,559
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

313
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:58,302
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

314
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:03,200
Run! Run! Go!

315
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,013
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

316
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,048
but he sure is fast.

317
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,881
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,</i>

318
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:28,010
<i>but college was
very confusing times.</i>

319
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,685
<i>Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,</i>

320
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:34,018
<i>integrated the University
of Alabama today.</i>

321
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,613
<i>Two Negroes were admitted,</i>

322
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:37,624
<i>but only after
Governor George Wallace</i>

323
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,626
<i>had carried out
his symbolic threat</i>

324
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,126
<i>to stand in the schoolhouse door.</i>

325
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,957
I take it from that statement...

326
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,962
Earl, what's going on?

327
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,463
Coons are trying
to get into school.

328
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:52,465
Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,

329
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,967
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

330
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:56,899
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

331
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,902
And they want to go
to school with us.

332
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,904
With us? They do?

333
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:03,904
<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace</i>

334
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:06,906
<i>had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,</i>

335
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:10,033
<i>Kennedy ordered the secretary
of defense to use military force.</i>

336
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,441
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter</i>

337
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,943
<i>by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,</i>

338
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,570
<i>and Governor Wallace.</i>

339
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Because these National Guardsmen</i>

340
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,916
<i>are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,</i>

341
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,916
<i>and they live within our borders.</i>

342
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:26,917
<i>They are our brothers.</i>

343
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,578
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

344
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:32,587
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

345
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times</i>

346
00:23:36,658 --> 00:23:38,591
<i>that is so evident today...</i>

347
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:42,458
<i>A trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.</i>

348
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:47,429
<i>And so, at day's end,</i>

349
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:50,953
<i>the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,</i>

350
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,557
<i>and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone</i>

351
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:57,500
<i>had been signed up
for summer classes.</i>

352
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,065
Ma'am, you dropped your book.

353
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:02,729
Ma'am.

354
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,238
<i>Governor Wallace
did what he promised.</i>

355
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,900
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...</i>

356
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,442
Say, wasn't that Gump?

357
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,533
Naw, that couldn't be.

358
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,545
It sure as hell was.

359
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,915
<i>A few years later,</i>

360
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:23,414
<i>that angry little man
at the schoolhouse door</i>

361
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:26,509
<i>thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for president.</i>

362
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:32,615
<i>But somebody thought
that it wasn't.</i>

363
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,281
But he didn't die.

364
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,392
My bus is here.

365
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,394
Is it the number 9?

366
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:46,394
No, it's the number 4.

367
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:48,986
It was nice talking to you.

368
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,895
I remember when that happened,

369
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,400
when Wallace got shot.

370
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:56,832
I was in college.

371
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:59,335
Did you go to a girls' college

372
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:01,769
or a girls' and boys'
together college?

373
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:03,031
It was coed.

374
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:05,834
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

375
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:07,999
It was a college
just for girls.

376
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:11,509
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

377
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:20,342
<i>~ I don't know why I love you ~</i>

378
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:23,904
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

379
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:29,741
<i>~ I don't know why I cry so ~</i>

380
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:32,285
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

381
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:39,819
<i>~ I only know I know that... ~</i>

382
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,824
Ohh!

383
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:43,324
That hurts.

384
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:48,351
<i>~ But I don't know why
I love you ~</i>

385
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,419
<i>~ But I do ~</i>

386
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:58,296
Forrest!

387
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,300
Forrest, stop it!

388
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:01,800
Stop it!

389
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,302
What are you doing?

390
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,803
He was hurting you.

391
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,303
No, he wasn't!

392
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:08,305
Get over there!

393
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:09,805
Billy, I'm sorry.

394
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,306
Just keep away from me.

395
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,307
Don't be such... Don't go.

396
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,309
Billy, wait a second.

397
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,741
He doesn't know any better.

398
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:22,404
Forrest, why'd you do that?

399
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:28,316
I brought you some chocolate.

400
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:29,611
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:34,818
I'll go back to my college now.

402
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,149
Forrest...

403
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,913
Look at you.

404
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,483
Come on.

405
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:54,096
Is this your own room?

406
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:55,097
Shh!

407
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:01,002
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

408
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,502
About who you're going to be?

409
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:07,170
Who I'm going to be?

410
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,169
Yeah.

411
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,172
Aren't I going to be me?

412
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,501
You'll always be you,

413
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:13,508
just another kind of you.

414
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:15,667
You know?

415
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:17,677
I want to be famous.

416
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:22,504
I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.

417
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,514
I just want to be...

418
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,013
On an empty stage

419
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,675
with my guitar, my voice.

420
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:31,342
Just me.

421
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,520
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

422
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,355
I want to be able
to say things,

423
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:42,856
just one to one.

424
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:52,286
Have you ever been
with a girl, Forrest?

425
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,629
I sit next to them

426
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:58,188
in my home economics class
all the time.

427
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,873
Oh...

428
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,376
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:29,473
It's O.K.

430
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,482
Sorry.

431
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,980
Oh...

432
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,654
Oh...

433
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:39,210
It's all right.

434
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:43,890
It's O.K.

435
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,390
Oh, I'm dizzy.

436
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,661
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

437
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,333
No.

438
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,470
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

439
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:13,972
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

440
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,308
Run! Run! Run! Run!

441
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:22,344
Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

442
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:25,345
Stop! Stop! Stop!

443
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:31,482
<i>College ran by real fast</i>

444
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,719
<i>'cause I played
so much football.</i>

445
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:35,977
<i>They even put me on a thing</i>

446
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:37,484
<i>called the all-America team</i>

447
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:39,316
<i>where you get to meet</i>

448
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:41,321
<i>the president of the United States.</i>

449
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:42,650
President Kennedy met

450
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,883
with the collegiate
all-American football team

451
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,391
at the Oval Office today.

452
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:48,217
<i>Now the really good thing</i>

453
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,224
<i>about meeting the president
of the United States</i>

454
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,725
<i>is the food.</i>

455
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:55,056
<i>They put you in this little room</i>

456
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,721
<i>with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

457
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,388
<i>But since, number one,</i>

458
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,055
<i>I wasn't hungry but thirsty,</i>

459
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:04,725
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

460
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,565
<i>I must have drank me
about 15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

461
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,696
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

462
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,034
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

463
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,698
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

464
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,742
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

465
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:22,401
<i>How does it feel
to be an all-American?</i>

466
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:23,909
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

467
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,911
<i>Congratulations.
How do you feel?</i>

468
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,411
<i>I got to pee.</i>

469
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:31,004
<i>I believe he said
he had to pee.</i>

470
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:48,352
<i>Some time later,
for no particular reason,</i>

471
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:51,722
<i>somebody shot
that nice young president</i>

472
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,192
<i>when he was riding
in his car.</i>

473
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:56,125
<i>And a few years after that,</i>

474
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:58,628
<i>somebody shot
his little brother, too,</i>

475
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:01,027
<i>only he was
in a hotel kitchen.</i>

476
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:04,357
Must be hard being brothers.

477
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,264
I wouldn't know.

478
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,729
Forrest Gump.

479
00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:10,235
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

480
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,735
<i>After only five years
of playing football,</i>

481
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,396
<i>I got a college degree.</i>

482
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,065
Congratulations, son.

483
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,265
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

484
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,771
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

485
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,434
I'll hold this for you.

486
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,602
Congratulations, son.

487
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,272
Have you given any thought
to your future?

488
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,814
Thought?

489
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,982
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

490
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,641
Nobody gives a horse's shit

491
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:39,309
who you are, pus ball!

492
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,148
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

493
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,483
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

494
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,988
You're in the army now!

495
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,817
Seat's taken.

496
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,150
Taken.

497
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:57,127
<i>At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.</i>

498
00:31:57,196 --> 00:31:59,128
<i>It was only
my induction day,</i>

499
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:01,255
<i>and I was getting yelled at.</i>

500
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,426
Sit down if you want to.

501
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,763
<i>I didn't know who I might meet</i>

502
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,268
<i>or what they might ask.</i>

503
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:14,099
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

504
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:15,933
No.

505
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:18,768
But I been on a real big boat.

506
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:21,774
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

507
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:24,776
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.

508
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:27,107
I started out
on my uncle's boat

509
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,111
when I was about maybe 9.

510
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,113
I was just looking
into buying my own boat

511
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,114
and got drafted.

512
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:37,446
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

513
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,780
People call me Bubba,

514
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:42,286
just like one of them
old redneck boys.

515
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:43,615
Can you believe that?

516
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:45,780
My name's Forrest Gump.

517
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:48,119
People call me Forrest Gump.

518
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,123
<i>So Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

519
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:52,920
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp.</i>

520
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:57,258
<i>And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,</i>

521
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:00,921
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

522
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,759
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

523
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:05,264
<i>there was to know about
the shrimping business.</i>

524
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,596
I know everything
there is to know

525
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:08,928
about the shrimping business.

526
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:11,435
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

527
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:13,766
after I get out of the army.

528
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:17,661
O.K.

529
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,000
Gump!

530
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,667
What's your sole purpose
in this army?

531
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:24,174
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

532
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:27,837
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

533
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:30,344
That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.

534
00:33:30,412 --> 00:33:33,006
You must have
a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.

535
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:35,674
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

536
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:39,180
Listen up, people!

537
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:42,185
<i>Now for some reason,
I fit in the army</i>

538
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,187
<i>like one of them round pegs.</i>

539
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,516
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

540
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,521
<i>You just make your bed neat,</i>

541
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,021
<i>remember to stand up straight,</i>

542
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,682
<i>and always answer every question</i>

543
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:52,690
<i>with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."</i>

544
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:54,191
Is that clear?

545
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,523
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

546
00:33:56,594 --> 00:34:00,028
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

547
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:01,358
On a good day,

548
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,363
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

549
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:05,693
Everything goes all right,

550
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,528
2 men shrimping 10 hours,

551
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,692
less what you spends on gas...

552
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,860
Done, Drill Sergeant!

553
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:13,369
Gump!

554
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:17,871
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

555
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:19,873
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

556
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,531
Jesus H. Christ.

557
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,541
This is a new company record.

558
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,041
If it wasn't a waste

559
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,542
of a fine enlisted man,

560
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,043
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

561
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:31,376
You're going to be
a general someday!

562
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,379
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

563
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,382
Anyway, like I was saying,

564
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,712
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

565
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:43,048
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

566
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,552
bake it, sauté it.

567
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,713
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

568
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:51,723
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

569
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,053
stir fried.

570
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,887
There's pineapple shrimp

571
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,825
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

572
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,020
pepper shrimp,

573
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:01,527
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

574
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:03,188
shrimp salad,

575
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:05,026
shrimp in potatoes,

576
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,530
shrimp burger,

577
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,361
shrimp sandwich.

578
00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:12,693
That... That's about it.

579
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:20,100
<i>Nighttime in the army
is a lonely time.</i>

580
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,607
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks,</i>

581
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:25,108
<i>and I'd miss my mama,</i>

582
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:27,769
<i>and I'd miss Jenny.</i>

583
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,113
Hey, Gump.

584
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:35,773
Get a load of the tits on her.

585
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,955
<i>Turns out...</i>

586
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,114
<i>Jenny had gotten
into some trouble</i>

587
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,455
<i>over some photos of her
in her college sweater.</i>

588
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:57,720
<i>And she was
thrown out of school.</i>

589
00:35:57,794 --> 00:36:00,956
~ My baby does the hanky panky ~

590
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,461
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

591
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,964
<i>'cause a man who owns a theater</i>

592
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:07,464
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

593
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,124
<i>saw those photos</i>

594
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,965
<i>and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

595
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:15,127
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

596
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:17,466
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis</i>

597
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:19,801
<i>to see her perform in that show.</i>

598
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,304
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

599
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:22,806
Give her a big hand.

600
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:25,807
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

601
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,638
direct from Hollywood,
California,

602
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,473
our very own beatnik beauty.

603
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:31,808
Let's give a big round of applause

604
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,641
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

605
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:48,650
~ How many roads
must a man walk down ~

606
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:54,089
~ Before you can
call him a man? ~

607
00:36:54,157 --> 00:37:00,355
~ Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail ~

608
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,361
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

609
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,363
~ Before she sleeps
in the sand? ~

610
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,260
<i>She was a folksinger.</i>

611
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:09,424
~ Yes, and how many times ~

612
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,558
~ Must the cannonballs fly ~

613
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:17,229
~ Before they're
forever banned? ~

614
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:18,635
Shake it up now.

615
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:20,137
Somebody get her a harmonica.

616
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:21,935
~ The answer, my friend ~

617
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,769
~ ls blowin' in the wind ~

618
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,274
<i>This ain't Captain Kangaroo.</i>

619
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:28,104
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

620
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:30,235
Hey! God damn it!

621
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,575
Hey, you stupid jerk!

622
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,408
I'm singing a song here.

623
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:38,915
Polly, get out here!

624
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,415
Shut up yourself!

625
00:37:41,484 --> 00:37:42,951
Just shut up!

626
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,454
Forrest! What are you
doing here?

627
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:49,852
What are you doing?

628
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:50,853
- Hey!
- Aw!

629
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:52,684
What are you doing, Forrest?

630
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,782
Let me down!

631
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:57,382
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!

632
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:58,861
Ha ha ha!

633
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:01,427
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

634
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,927
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

635
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,793
They was trying to grab you.

636
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:08,195
A lot of people try to grab me.

637
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:12,257
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

638
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:15,860
I can't help it.
I love you.

639
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:18,199
Forrest...

640
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,238
You don't know what love is.

641
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,910
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

642
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:34,746
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

643
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,746
so I could fly far away.

644
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,573
Yes, I do.

645
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,984
You think I could
fly off this bridge?

646
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:55,247
What do you mean, Jenny?

647
00:38:58,426 --> 00:38:59,687
Nothing.

648
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:05,024
I got to get out of here.

649
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,357
Wait, Jenny.

650
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,864
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O.K.?

651
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,866
You stay away from me, please.

652
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,367
Can I have a ride?

653
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,697
Where are you going?

654
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,860
I don't care.

655
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:18,164
Get in the truck.

656
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:20,431
So bye-bye, Jenny.

657
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,705
They sending me to Vietnam.

658
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,240
It's this whole other country.

659
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:33,573
Just hang on a minute.

660
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:38,080
Listen, you promise me
something, O.K.?

661
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:40,081
Just if you're ever in trouble,

662
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:41,411
don't be brave.

663
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:44,418
You just run, O.K.?
Just run away.

664
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:45,849
O.K.

665
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,351
Jenny.

666
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,016
I'll write you all the time.

667
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:09,193
<i>And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

668
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,873
You come back safe to me.

669
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,374
Do you hear?

670
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,544
~ Some folks are born ~

671
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,883
~ Made to wave the flag ~

672
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:55,218
~ Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue ~

673
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,815
~ And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" ~

674
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:02,485
~ Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you ~

675
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:06,328
~ it ain't me ~

676
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,489
~ I ain't no senator's son ~

677
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:11,327
~ it ain't me ~

678
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,831
<i>Now they told us</i>

679
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,833
<i>that Vietnam was going
to be very different</i>

680
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:17,925
<i>from the United States
of America.</i>

681
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:22,096
<i>Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,</i>

682
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:23,933
<i>it was.</i>

683
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:36,771
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

684
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:39,780
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

685
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:41,781
After we win this war

686
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:43,476
and we take over everything,

687
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,812
we can get American
shrimpers out here

688
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:47,146
and shrimp these waters.

689
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:49,152
Just shrimp all the time, man.

690
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:54,151
You must be my FNGs.

691
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,315
Morning, sir.

692
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,912
Oh, get your hands down.

693
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,423
Do not salute me.

694
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,925
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

695
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:03,085
who'd love
to grease an officer.

696
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:06,425
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

697
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:09,254
What's wrong with your lip?

698
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:12,594
I was born with big gums, sir.

699
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,757
Well, you better tuck that in.

700
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,267
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.

701
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,936
Where are you boys
from in the world?

702
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:22,095
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

703
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,305
You twins?

704
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,133
No. We are not relations, sir.

705
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:32,471
Look,

706
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:33,874
it's pretty basic here.

707
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,206
You stick with me

708
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:37,711
and learn from the guys

709
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:39,713
who've been in country a while,

710
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:41,041
you'll be all right.

711
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:43,378
There is one item of G.I. Gear

712
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,543
that can be the difference
between life and death...

713
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:47,675
Socks.

714
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:49,776
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.

715
00:42:49,853 --> 00:42:51,683
Try and keep your feet dry.

716
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:54,187
When we're out humpin',
change your socks

717
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,449
whenever we stop.

718
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:57,787
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet

719
00:42:57,858 --> 00:42:59,289
right off his legs.

720
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:00,791
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

721
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:03,292
where's that sling rope
I said to order?

722
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:04,793
I put in the requisitions.

723
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:07,124
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

724
00:43:07,196 --> 00:43:09,288
<i>Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

725
00:43:09,363 --> 00:43:12,298
<i>I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.</i>

726
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:16,027
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

727
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,625
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought</i>

728
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:20,168
<i>and died</i>

729
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:21,827
<i>in every...</i>

730
00:43:21,904 --> 00:43:23,030
<i>single...</i>

731
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:25,197
<i>American war.</i>

732
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:27,206
God damn it, kick some ass.

733
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,535
Get on it!

734
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,040
<i>I guess you could say</i>

735
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:32,541
<i>he had a lot to live up to.</i>

736
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,543
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

737
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:36,703
Well,

738
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:38,540
I been through there.

739
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:41,376
Little Rock's a fine town.

740
00:43:41,448 --> 00:43:43,210
Now, shake down your gear.

741
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:44,544
See the platoon sergeant.

742
00:43:44,616 --> 00:43:47,379
Draw what you need
for the field.

743
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,884
If you boys are hungry,

744
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,715
we got steaks burning
right over here.

745
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:54,550
Two standing orders
in this platoon...

746
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:57,145
1... take care of your feet,

747
00:43:57,223 --> 00:44:00,816
2... try not to do
anything stupid,

748
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,483
like getting yourself killed.

749
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,253
I sure hope I don't
let him down.

750
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:25,371
<i>I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

751
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:27,838
<i>We would take
these real long walks.</i>

752
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:31,841
~ There must be
some kind of way ~

753
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:34,001
~ Out of here ~

754
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,169
~ Said the joker to the thief ~

755
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:37,677
<i>And we were always lookin'</i>

756
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,679
<i>for this guy named Charlie.</i>

757
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:41,337
~ There's too much confusion ~

758
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:45,511
~ I can't get no relief ~

759
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:49,176
Hold it up!

760
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:50,685
Hold up, boys!

761
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:55,278
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

762
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:58,618
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings</i>

763
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,784
<i>about a rock or a trail
or the road,</i>

764
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:04,792
<i>so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.</i>

765
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,951
Get down!

766
00:45:06,027 --> 00:45:07,119
Shut up!

767
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:09,456
<i>So we did.</i>

768
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:29,236
<i>Now I don't know
much about anything,</i>

769
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:32,240
<i>but I think some of
America's best young men</i>

770
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:33,570
<i>served in this war.</i>

771
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,906
<i>There was Dallas from Phoenix.</i>

772
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:40,074
<i>Cleveland...
he was from Detroit.</i>

773
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:42,936
Hey, Tex.

774
00:45:43,014 --> 00:45:44,606
What the hell's going on?

775
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:46,876
<i>And Tex was...</i>

776
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,542
<i>Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from...</i>

777
00:45:49,618 --> 00:45:51,142
Ah, nothing.

778
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:57,078
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

779
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,055
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

780
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,715
Move out.

781
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,224
1, 2! Hup!

782
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:07,060
Step it up!

783
00:46:07,128 --> 00:46:08,458
Look alive out there.

784
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:09,961
<i>The good thing about Vietnam</i>

785
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,292
<i>is there was always
someplace to go.</i>

786
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:13,626
Fire in the hole!

787
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,793
Gump, check out that hole.

788
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:22,801
<i>And there was always
something to do.</i>

789
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:23,961
Mount 'em up!

790
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:25,834
Spread out!
Cover his back!

791
00:46:30,907 --> 00:46:33,500
<i>One day it started raining,</i>

792
00:46:33,576 --> 00:46:36,907
<i>and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

793
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:40,412
<i>We've been through
every kind of rain there is...</i>

794
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,107
<i>little bitty stinging rain</i>

795
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:47,081
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

796
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,950
<i>rain that flew in sideways,</i>

797
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,742
<i>and sometimes rain even seemed</i>

798
00:46:51,816 --> 00:46:55,148
<i>to come straight up
from underneath.</i>

799
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:58,743
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

800
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,583
Hey, Forrest.

801
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:01,747
Hey, Bubba.

802
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:04,085
I'm going to lean up against you.

803
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:05,590
You lean up against me.

804
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,921
This way we don't have to sleep

805
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,925
with our heads in the mud.

806
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,587
You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?

807
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:15,925
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

808
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:17,759
like brothers and stuff.

809
00:47:19,665 --> 00:47:21,256
Hey, Forrest,

810
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,426
something I been thinking about.

811
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:26,434
I got a very important
question to ask you.

812
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,104
How would you like to go

813
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:32,104
into the shrimping
business with me?

814
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:34,935
O.K.

815
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:36,769
Man, I tell you what.

816
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:39,104
I got it all figured out, too.

817
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:40,609
So many pounds of shrimp

818
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:42,110
will pay off the boat.

819
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:43,610
So many pounds for gas.

820
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:45,612
We'll live right on the boat.

821
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,943
We ain't got to pay no rent.

822
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,947
We can just work it together,

823
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,949
split everything right
down the middle.

824
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:54,108
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

825
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:57,209
Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

826
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:01,379
That's a fine idea.

827
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:04,219
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

828
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,886
<i>I even wrote Jenny</i>

829
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,892
<i>and told her all about it.</i>

830
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,551
<i>I sent her letters...</i>

831
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,720
<i>Not every day, but almost.</i>

832
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:17,058
<i>I told her what I was doing</i>

833
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,563
<i>and asked her what she was doing</i>

834
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,865
<i>and told her how
I thought about her always.</i>

835
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,166
<i>And how I was looking forward</i>

836
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:28,167
<i>to getting a letter from her</i>

837
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:30,998
<i>just as soon
as she had the time.</i>

838
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,003
<i>I'd always let her know
that I was O.K.</i>

839
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:41,497
<i>Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

840
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:54,177
~ There's somethin'
happenin' here ~

841
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:59,109
<i>This one day, we was out
walking like always,</i>

842
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:02,949
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

843
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,954
<i>somebody turned off the rain,</i>

844
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:06,613
<i>and the sun come out.</i>

845
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:09,452
~ I got to beware ~

846
00:49:09,524 --> 00:49:11,616
Ambush!

847
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:13,624
Take cover!

848
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:24,865
Get that pig up here,
god damn it!

849
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:27,125
Forrest! You okay?

850
00:49:29,735 --> 00:49:32,634
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

851
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,500
Hey! We got a man down!

852
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:39,028
Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

853
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,540
Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming

854
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:44,007
from the treeline at point blue

855
00:49:44,076 --> 00:49:46,407
plus two!
A.K.S and rockets!

856
00:49:46,477 --> 00:49:47,738
We're getting it hard!

857
00:49:47,811 --> 00:49:49,369
Misfire! Misfire!

858
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,243
God damn it!

859
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:57,749
Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!

860
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:02,177
They got us, and it hurt.

861
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:05,743
We're going to move
back to the blue line.

862
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:08,721
Pull back! Pull back!

863
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,779
Forrest! Run, Forrest!

864
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:12,585
Pull back!

865
00:50:12,658 --> 00:50:14,853
Run! Run, man!

866
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:16,017
Run!

867
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:17,355
Pull back, Gump!

868
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:22,090
Run, God damn it! Run!

869
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:52,036
<i>I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

870
00:50:54,782 --> 00:50:56,975
<i>I ran so far so fast</i>

871
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:59,482
<i>that pretty soon
I was all by myself,</i>

872
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,142
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

873
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:02,310
Bubba.

874
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:06,979
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

875
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:09,488
<i>I had to make sure he was O.K.</i>

876
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,994
Where the hell are you?

877
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:23,155
Bubba!

878
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:26,164
<i>And on my way
back to find Bubba,</i>

879
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:28,995
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

880
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:30,055
Tex.

881
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,593
O.K.

882
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,102
<i>I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,</i>

883
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,603
<i>scared the way he was,</i>

884
00:51:37,672 --> 00:51:39,434
<i>so I grabbed him up</i>

885
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:41,234
<i>and run him out of there.</i>

886
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,177
<i>Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

887
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,683
<i>somebody else was saying,</i>

888
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,685
<i>"Help me, Forrest, help me!"</i>

889
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:12,435
O.K. Here. Here.

890
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,756
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.

891
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:24,674
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

892
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:26,198
I know my position

893
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:28,181
is danger close!

894
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,704
We got Charlie
all over this area.

895
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:33,731
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

896
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:36,253
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

897
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,768
I know he's dead!

898
00:52:37,836 --> 00:52:40,794
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

899
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:42,308
God damn it!

900
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:44,326
What are you doing?

901
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,839
You leave me here!

902
00:52:45,908 --> 00:52:47,858
Get away.
Just leave me here!

903
00:52:47,926 --> 00:52:49,371
Get out!

904
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:53,408
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

905
00:52:53,476 --> 00:52:55,861
<i>Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.</i>

906
00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:58,925
<i>Be advised your fast movers
are inbound. Over.</i>

907
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:02,420
<i>Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

908
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,276
Aah! Something bit me!

909
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:12,168
Aah! Aah!

910
00:53:12,244 --> 00:53:14,194
You son of a bitch!

911
00:53:14,263 --> 00:53:15,604
Aah!

912
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:18,699
I can't leave the platoon.

913
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:21,711
I told you
to leave me there, Gump.

914
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:23,745
Forget about me.
Get yourself out!

915
00:53:23,812 --> 00:53:26,042
Did you hear what I said?

916
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,548
Gump, damn it, put me down.

917
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:31,140
Get your ass out of here.

918
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,245
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

919
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,255
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

920
00:53:39,323 --> 00:53:40,754
To get Bubba.

921
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:43,757
I got an air strike
inbound right now.

922
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:46,315
They're going to nape
the whole area.

923
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,860
Stay here!
That's an order.

924
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:49,361
I gotta find Bubba!

925
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:06,266
Forrest.

926
00:54:13,577 --> 00:54:14,907
Bubba.

927
00:54:14,977 --> 00:54:16,807
I'm O.K., Forrest.

928
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,402
I'm O.K.

929
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:28,842
O-Oh, Bubba, no.

930
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:30,715
I'll be all right.

931
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:40,183
Come on.

932
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:41,988
Come on. Come on.

933
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:48,658
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

934
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,533
I'm O.K. I'm fine.

935
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:33,048
Top smoke. Get it up there.

936
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,990
<i>If I'd have known
this was going to be</i>

937
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,993
<i>the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

938
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:41,995
<i>I'd of thought of
something better to say.</i>

939
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:43,120
Hey, Bubba.

940
00:55:43,197 --> 00:55:44,459
Hey, Forrest.

941
00:55:46,898 --> 00:55:48,331
Forrest...

942
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,492
Why did this happen?

943
00:55:51,568 --> 00:55:54,503
You got shot.

944
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:58,938
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

945
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:02,567
I want to go home.

946
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:05,439
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

947
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,444
<i>And even I know</i>

948
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:10,946
<i>that ain't something you can
find just around the corner.</i>

949
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:14,448
<i>Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

950
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:18,814
<i>but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

951
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:26,720
That's all I have
to say about that.

952
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:31,119
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

953
00:56:33,027 --> 00:56:34,460
A bullet?

954
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:37,256
That jumped up and bit you.

955
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:40,262
Oh. Yes, sir.

956
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:42,958
Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.

957
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:47,469
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

958
00:56:47,536 --> 00:56:49,469
The army must keep that money,

959
00:56:49,537 --> 00:56:53,472
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

960
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,341
The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks

961
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,236
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

962
00:56:59,308 --> 00:57:02,208
<i>They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.</i>

963
00:57:02,277 --> 00:57:03,709
<i>And guess what?</i>

964
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:07,678
<i>A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.</i>

965
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,039
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

966
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,647
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

967
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:30,255
It's time for
your bath, Lieutenant.

968
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:39,896
Harper!

969
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:44,934
Cooper.

970
00:57:45,002 --> 00:57:45,933
Larson.

971
00:57:48,004 --> 00:57:49,265
Webster.

972
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:51,938
Gump.

973
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,438
Gump!

974
00:57:53,507 --> 00:57:55,134
I'm Forrest Gump.

975
00:57:57,443 --> 00:57:58,841
Kyle.

976
00:58:00,445 --> 00:58:01,776
Nichols.

977
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,879
McMill.

978
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:06,937
Johnson.

979
00:58:18,055 --> 00:58:21,022
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

980
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:27,259
Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?

981
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:28,760
Turn it off.

982
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:31,260
<i>You are tuned
to the American forces</i>

983
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:32,762
<i>Vietnam network.</i>

984
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,387
<i>This is channel 6, Saigon.</i>

985
00:58:36,832 --> 00:58:38,492
Good catch, Gump.

986
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:42,234
You know how to play this?

987
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,304
Come on. Let me show you.

988
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,272
Now, the secret to this game is

989
00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:52,274
no matter what happens,

990
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:54,775
never, ever...

991
00:58:54,843 --> 00:58:56,935
Take your eye off the ball.

992
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:01,107
All right.

993
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,781
<i>For some reason,</i>

994
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:08,283
<i>Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

995
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:09,512
See?

996
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:11,779
Any idiot can play.

997
00:59:11,853 --> 00:59:15,288
<i>So I started playing it
all the time.</i>

998
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:16,982
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

999
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:20,651
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

1000
00:59:28,997 --> 00:59:30,430
<i>The hospital's people</i>

1001
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:34,432
<i>said it made me look
like a duck in water...</i>

1002
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,933
<i>Whatever that means.</i>

1003
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:39,231
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.</i>

1004
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:46,438
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,</i>

1005
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:49,339
<i>I even played it in my sleep.</i>

1006
00:59:56,445 --> 00:59:57,377
Now...

1007
00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:58,879
You listen to me.

1008
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:00,881
We all have a destiny.

1009
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:04,383
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

1010
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,441
I should have died
out there with my men,

1011
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,511
but now... I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

1012
01:00:11,589 --> 01:00:13,282
a legless freak!

1013
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:15,448
Look. Look! Look at me!

1014
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:16,957
You see that?

1015
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:18,889
Do you know what it's like

1016
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:21,951
not to be able to use your legs?

1017
01:00:23,963 --> 01:00:26,021
Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.

1018
01:00:29,466 --> 01:00:32,228
Did you hear what I said?

1019
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:34,166
You cheated me!

1020
01:00:34,236 --> 01:00:35,668
I had a destiny.

1021
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:38,260
I was supposed
to die in the field

1022
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:39,532
with honor!

1023
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:41,334
That was my destiny,

1024
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:44,375
and you...
cheated me out of it!

1025
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:55,278
You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1026
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,842
This wasn't supposed
to happen...

1027
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,714
Not to me.

1028
01:01:04,254 --> 01:01:05,777
I had a destiny.

1029
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:09,347
I was...

1030
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:11,186
Lieutenant...

1031
01:01:11,258 --> 01:01:12,986
Dan Taylor.

1032
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:19,796
Y-You still

1033
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:21,523
Lieutenant Dan.

1034
01:01:43,878 --> 01:01:45,310
Look at me.

1035
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,313
What am I going to do now?

1036
01:01:51,883 --> 01:01:54,680
What am I going to do now?

1037
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,016
PFC Gump?

1038
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,621
Yes, sir!

1039
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:11,091
As you were.

1040
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,319
Son,

1041
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:15,897
you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

1042
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,259
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1043
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:21,060
They want to give me a med...

1044
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:28,770
Ma'am.

1045
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:31,271
What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

1046
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:33,203
They sent him home.

1047
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:43,210
<i>Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.</i>

1048
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,770
<i>The ceremony was kicked off</i>

1049
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,939
<i>with a candid speech
by the president</i>

1050
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:51,451
<i>regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.</i>

1051
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,453
<i>Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.</i>

1052
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,420
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

1053
01:02:59,356 --> 01:03:01,289
<i>I understand you were wounded.</i>

1054
01:03:01,357 --> 01:03:03,291
<i>Where were you hit?</i>

1055
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,949
<i>In the but-tocks, sir.</i>

1056
01:03:05,026 --> 01:03:06,960
<i>Well, that must be a sight.</i>

1057
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:09,790
<i>I'd kinda like to see that.</i>

1058
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:13,627
~ And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson ~

1059
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,757
~ Jesus loves you more
than you will know ~

1060
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:20,333
~ Whoa, whoa, whoa ~

1061
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:23,734
~ God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson ~

1062
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,465
God damn, son!

1063
01:03:27,306 --> 01:03:30,742
<i>After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,</i>

1064
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:34,743
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

1065
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,744
Hilary! I got the vets.

1066
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:39,609
What do you want
to do with them?

1067
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:42,240
<i>It's a good thing
Mama was resting,</i>

1068
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:45,249
<i>'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people</i>

1069
01:03:45,317 --> 01:03:48,252
<i>lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,</i>

1070
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,253
<i>and some of them people
were loud and pushy.</i>

1071
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:53,152
O.K., follow me!

1072
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:56,519
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

1073
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:04,386
Come on.

1074
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:05,451
Go!

1075
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,700
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.

1076
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:19,134
Good.

1077
01:04:19,204 --> 01:04:20,694
O.K.

1078
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:23,705
<i>There was this man
giving a little talk.</i>

1079
01:04:23,773 --> 01:04:25,206
<i>And for some reason,</i>

1080
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:28,209
<i>he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.</i>

1081
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:33,712
<i>And he liked to say
the "F" word... a lot.</i>

1082
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,042
<i>"F" this and "F" that.</i>

1083
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:39,083
<i>And every time
he said the "F" word,</i>

1084
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,208
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.</i>

1085
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:46,446
Yeah! Yeah!

1086
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:50,981
Come on, man.
Come up here, man.

1087
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,421
Come on. Come on.

1088
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:54,651
Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

1089
01:04:56,294 --> 01:04:58,260
Go on. Let's get up there.

1090
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:13,761
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

1091
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:15,736
The war in Vietnam?

1092
01:05:15,804 --> 01:05:18,568
The war in Viet...

1093
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,197
Fucking-nam!

1094
01:05:44,255 --> 01:05:45,688
Well...

1095
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:48,690
<i>There was only one thing
I could say</i>

1096
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:50,191
<i>about the war in Vietnam.</i>

1097
01:05:50,259 --> 01:05:53,193
There's only one thing
I can say about...

1098
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:54,750
The war in Vietnam.

1099
01:05:58,264 --> 01:06:00,128
In Vietnam...

1100
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:13,205
What the hell are you do...

1101
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:16,207
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

1102
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:18,707
Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?

1103
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:20,744
Can't hear you!

1104
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,641
Can't hear anything!

1105
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:26,646
This... This one!

1106
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:27,646
Give me that!

1107
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:30,274
Speak up!

1108
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,112
That's it.

1109
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:34,549
And that's all I have to say

1110
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:36,382
about that.

1111
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,919
That's so right on, man.

1112
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:46,458
You said it all.

1113
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:50,154
What's your name, man?

1114
01:06:50,228 --> 01:06:53,663
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1115
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:55,288
Forrest Gump.

1116
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:56,627
- Gump! Gump!
- Gump!

1117
01:06:58,233 --> 01:07:00,200
Forrest!

1118
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:02,701
Forrest!

1119
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,005
Jenny!

1120
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:09,096
Forrest!

1121
01:07:24,516 --> 01:07:25,914
Hey!

1122
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:39,522
<i>It was the happiest
moment of my life.</i>

1123
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:45,126
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

1124
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,628
<i>She showed me around</i>

1125
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:49,629
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

1126
01:07:49,697 --> 01:07:51,130
Shut that blind, man!

1127
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,132
And get your white ass
away from that window.

1128
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,490
Don't you know we in a war here?

1129
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:58,465
He's cool.
He's one of us.

1130
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:00,467
Let me tell you about us.

1131
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,469
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

1132
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,004
from the racial
onslaught of the pig

1133
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:08,903
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

1134
01:08:08,973 --> 01:08:12,168
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

1135
01:08:12,241 --> 01:08:13,640
Who's the baby killer?

1136
01:08:13,709 --> 01:08:16,642
This is my good friend
I told you about.

1137
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,645
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

1138
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:22,146
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

1139
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:25,148
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1140
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:28,150
We are here to offer
protection and help

1141
01:08:28,218 --> 01:08:30,651
for all those
who need our help,

1142
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,152
because we, the Black Panthers,

1143
01:08:32,221 --> 01:08:34,153
are against the war in Vietnam.

1144
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:35,654
We are against any war

1145
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:38,656
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

1146
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:41,658
to die for a country
that hates them.

1147
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:45,660
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

1148
01:08:45,728 --> 01:08:49,254
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

1149
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:52,230
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

1150
01:08:54,734 --> 01:08:56,996
~ And I gave her the gun ~

1151
01:08:57,068 --> 01:08:58,660
~ I shot her ~

1152
01:09:00,738 --> 01:09:02,226
Forrest!

1153
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,063
Stop it!

1154
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,403
Forrest!

1155
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,875
Stop it! Stop it!

1156
01:09:18,683 --> 01:09:21,115
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1157
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:25,880
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

1158
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,512
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

1159
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:35,522
Come on, Forrest.

1160
01:09:40,629 --> 01:09:45,462
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

1161
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:50,065
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

1162
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:52,601
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1163
01:09:54,536 --> 01:09:56,469
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

1164
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:01,233
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

1165
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,873
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1166
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,580
You look handsome in it.

1167
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:19,378
You do.

1168
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,085
You know what?

1169
01:10:24,154 --> 01:10:25,246
What?

1170
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:31,988
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

1171
01:10:33,492 --> 01:10:35,084
Me, too, Forrest.

1172
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:38,618
<i>We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,</i>

1173
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:40,628
<i>just talkin'.</i>

1174
01:10:40,696 --> 01:10:45,461
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done</i>

1175
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,400
<i>and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind</i>

1176
01:10:49,469 --> 01:10:53,072
<i>and learn how
to live in harmony...</i>

1177
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:55,104
<i>which must be
out west somewhere,</i>

1178
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:58,107
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

1179
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,108
~ Love one another right now ~

1180
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:01,108
Hey.

1181
01:11:02,177 --> 01:11:04,474
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

1182
01:11:04,545 --> 01:11:06,012
I'll go.

1183
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,409
Far out!

1184
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,913
<i>It was a very special night</i>

1185
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:11,676
<i>for the two of us.</i>

1186
01:11:13,383 --> 01:11:15,317
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

1187
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:18,350
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1188
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,143
I have to, Forrest.

1189
01:11:22,622 --> 01:11:23,554
Jenny?

1190
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:28,052
Things got
a little out of hand.

1191
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:29,718
It's just this war

1192
01:11:29,794 --> 01:11:32,556
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

1193
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:36,828
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

1194
01:11:39,632 --> 01:11:41,531
Know what I think?

1195
01:11:43,534 --> 01:11:44,967
I think...

1196
01:11:45,036 --> 01:11:47,060
You should go home to Greenbow,

1197
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:49,127
Alabama!

1198
01:11:59,144 --> 01:12:00,509
Forrest,

1199
01:12:01,645 --> 01:12:04,272
we have very
different lives, you know.

1200
01:12:13,153 --> 01:12:15,086
I want you...

1201
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:17,246
To have this.

1202
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,081
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1203
01:12:25,093 --> 01:12:26,526
I got it...

1204
01:12:26,595 --> 01:12:29,926
Just by doing
what you told me to do.

1205
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:34,861
Why are you so good to me?

1206
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:36,763
You're my girl.

1207
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:40,596
I'll always be your girl.

1208
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:08,475
~ To everything,
turn, turn, turn ~

1209
01:13:08,553 --> 01:13:13,045
~ There is a season,
turn, turn, turn ~

1210
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:16,887
~ And a time to every purpose ~

1211
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,981
~ Under heaven ~

1212
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,992
<i>And just like that,</i>

1213
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:27,019
<i>she was gone
out of my life again.</i>

1214
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:30,062
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

1215
01:13:32,066 --> 01:13:34,864
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1216
01:13:39,572 --> 01:13:42,505
<i>I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,</i>

1217
01:13:42,573 --> 01:13:44,006
<i>but instead they decided</i>

1218
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:47,007
<i>the best way for me
to fight the Communists</i>

1219
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:48,508
<i>was to play Ping-Pong,</i>

1220
01:13:48,577 --> 01:13:50,510
<i>so I was in the Special Services,</i>

1221
01:13:50,578 --> 01:13:52,169
<i>traveling around the country,</i>

1222
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:54,872
<i>cheering up wounded veterans
and showing 'em</i>

1223
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:56,505
how to play Ping-Pong.

1224
01:13:56,582 --> 01:13:59,549
I was so good
that some years later,

1225
01:13:59,616 --> 01:14:01,516
<i>the army decided I should be</i>

1226
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:03,744
<i>on the all-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

1227
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:07,083
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

1228
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,553
<i>in a million years or something.</i>

1229
01:14:09,622 --> 01:14:12,556
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

1230
01:14:12,624 --> 01:14:15,319
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

1231
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:18,259
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

1232
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,228
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

1233
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:22,395
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump.</i>

1234
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:23,828
<i>Right here.</i>

1235
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:32,636
<i>Gump, have a seat.</i>

1236
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:35,466
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

1237
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:37,472
<i>Welcome home.</i>

1238
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,472
<i>Can you tell us, um,</i>

1239
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,667
<i>what was China like?</i>

1240
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,969
<i>In the land of China...</i>

1241
01:14:47,046 --> 01:14:48,979
<i>people hardly got nothin'at all.</i>

1242
01:14:49,046 --> 01:14:51,207
<i>No possessions?</i>

1243
01:14:53,683 --> 01:14:58,482
<i>And in China,
they never go to church.</i>

1244
01:14:58,552 --> 01:14:59,985
<i>No religion, too?</i>

1245
01:15:00,054 --> 01:15:01,986
<i>Oh.</i>

1246
01:15:02,054 --> 01:15:03,646
<i>Hard to imagine.</i>

1247
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:06,985
<i>Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

1248
01:15:07,057 --> 01:15:08,490
<i>Some years later,</i>

1249
01:15:08,558 --> 01:15:10,492
<i>that nice young man from England</i>

1250
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,527
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

1251
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:15,494
<i>and was signing some autographs.</i>

1252
01:15:15,562 --> 01:15:17,427
<i>For no particular reason at all,</i>

1253
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,963
<i>somebody shot him.</i>

1254
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,433
They gave you...

1255
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,491
The congressional Medal of Honor.

1256
01:15:27,904 --> 01:15:29,699
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

1257
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,231
Lieutenant Dan!

1258
01:15:34,307 --> 01:15:36,171
They gave you...

1259
01:15:36,242 --> 01:15:39,267
The congressional
Medal of Honor.

1260
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,444
Yes, sir.
They surely did.

1261
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:44,342
They gave you,

1262
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:45,936
an imbecile,

1263
01:15:46,014 --> 01:15:47,947
a moron who goes on television

1264
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,449
and makes a fool out of himself

1265
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:53,484
in front of
the whole damn country,

1266
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:55,884
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1267
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,252
Yes, sir.

1268
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:03,752
<i>Well... that...
that's just perfect!</i>

1269
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:07,521
Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...

1270
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:09,958
Goddamn bless America.

1271
01:16:11,129 --> 01:16:12,494
Hey, hey!

1272
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:13,553
Whoa...

1273
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:16,292
Oh, God, whoa!

1274
01:16:16,366 --> 01:16:19,129
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

1275
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,827
Lieutenant Dan!

1276
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:23,892
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel</i>

1277
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,904
<i>and because he didn't
have no legs,</i>

1278
01:16:26,972 --> 01:16:29,906
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

1279
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,908
Make a right. Take a right!

1280
01:16:36,978 --> 01:16:37,909
Hey!

1281
01:16:37,978 --> 01:16:39,172
Ah, ah!

1282
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:42,907
What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

1283
01:16:42,981 --> 01:16:45,415
I'm living off
the government tit.

1284
01:16:48,852 --> 01:16:50,910
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

1285
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:52,419
I'm walking here!

1286
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:53,921
Ah, get out!

1287
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,648
Come on. Go, go, go!

1288
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:03,419
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan</i>

1289
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,825
<i>and celebrated the holidays.</i>

1290
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:12,493
<i>You have a great year,
and hurry home.</i>

1291
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:14,260
<i>God bless you.</i>

1292
01:17:16,503 --> 01:17:19,629
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

1293
01:17:21,072 --> 01:17:24,938
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.

1294
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:34,400
That's all these cripples
down at the V. A...

1295
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,879
That's all they ever
talk about.

1296
01:17:37,948 --> 01:17:42,178
Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.

1297
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:45,741
Have I... found Jesus?

1298
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:49,254
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

1299
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:51,881
He said God is listening,

1300
01:17:51,956 --> 01:17:54,890
but I have to help myself.

1301
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:57,891
Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,

1302
01:17:57,959 --> 01:18:02,394
I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1303
01:18:02,462 --> 01:18:04,692
Did you hear what I said?

1304
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:07,761
Walk...

1305
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,392
Beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1306
01:18:10,468 --> 01:18:12,901
Well... kiss my crippled ass.

1307
01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:14,902
God is listening?

1308
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:17,028
What a crock of shit.

1309
01:18:19,973 --> 01:18:22,463
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.

1310
01:18:24,976 --> 01:18:25,907
Oh?

1311
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,707
Well...

1312
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:35,839
Before you go...
why don't you

1313
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:38,351
get your ass down to the corner

1314
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:40,144
and get us more Ripple?

1315
01:18:40,218 --> 01:18:41,242
Yes, sir.

1316
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:42,751
<i>We're at approximately</i>

1317
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,913
<i>45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.</i>

1318
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:47,920
<i>This is the site of the old...</i>

1319
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:50,422
What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?

1320
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:51,924
Shrimping boats.

1321
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:55,426
Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?

1322
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:57,427
I got to buy me one

1323
01:18:57,495 --> 01:18:59,428
soon as I have some money.

1324
01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:00,929
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

1325
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:04,432
that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.

1326
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,934
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

1327
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,934
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

1328
01:19:11,002 --> 01:19:12,936
A shrimp boat captain.

1329
01:19:13,004 --> 01:19:16,097
Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1330
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:20,374
Now hear this!

1331
01:19:20,442 --> 01:19:21,875
Private Gump here

1332
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:24,376
is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

1333
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:26,378
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1334
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:29,379
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1335
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:32,382
I will come and be
your first mate.

1336
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:33,881
Ha ha ha!

1337
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,885
If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1338
01:19:36,953 --> 01:19:38,886
that's the day
I'm an astronaut!

1339
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:40,887
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1340
01:19:40,955 --> 01:19:42,387
Danny, how you doing, huh?

1341
01:19:42,455 --> 01:19:43,888
Mr. Hot Wheels!

1342
01:19:43,957 --> 01:19:45,389
Who's your friend?

1343
01:19:45,457 --> 01:19:47,924
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1344
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:50,426
This is cunning Carla

1345
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,427
and long-limbs Lenore.

1346
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:54,395
So where you been,
babycakes, huh?

1347
01:19:54,463 --> 01:19:56,395
Haven't seen you around lately.

1348
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:58,897
You should have been here
for Christmas,

1349
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:00,899
'cause Tommy bought a free round

1350
01:20:00,967 --> 01:20:02,900
and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.

1351
01:20:02,968 --> 01:20:04,901
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.

1352
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:06,903
Hey! Hey, we was just there!

1353
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:08,903
That's like Times Square.

1354
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,405
Don't you just love New Year's?

1355
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,905
You can start all over.

1356
01:20:13,974 --> 01:20:15,908
Everybody gets a second chance.

1357
01:20:15,976 --> 01:20:17,341
<i>It's funny...</i>

1358
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:20,344
<i>but in the middle
of all that fun,</i>

1359
01:20:20,412 --> 01:20:22,243
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1360
01:20:22,312 --> 01:20:25,747
<i>wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night</i>

1361
01:20:25,815 --> 01:20:28,476
<i>out in California.</i>

1362
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,847
~ Don't you love her ways? ~

1363
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:35,012
~ Tell me what you say ~

1364
01:20:35,088 --> 01:20:38,180
~ Don't you love her madly? ~

1365
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:41,349
~ Want to meet her daddy? ~

1366
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,484
~ Don't you love her face? ~

1367
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,358
~ Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? ~

1368
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:50,862
<i>9... 8...</i>

1369
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,864
<i>7... 6...</i>

1370
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:54,864
<i>5... 4...</i>

1371
01:20:54,932 --> 01:20:56,399
<i>3... 2...</i>

1372
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:57,399
<i>1!</i>

1373
01:20:57,468 --> 01:20:59,661
<i>Happy new year!</i>

1374
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:13,376
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

1375
01:21:13,444 --> 01:21:16,378
~ And never brought to mind ~

1376
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:19,312
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

1377
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:24,078
~ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot ~

1378
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:29,108
~ In days of auld lang syne ~

1379
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,715
~ Together we stand ~

1380
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:42,454
~ Divided we fall ~

1381
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:44,619
~ Come on now, people, let's ~

1382
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:45,627
~ Get on the ball ~

1383
01:21:45,696 --> 01:21:47,926
~ And work together ~

1384
01:21:47,997 --> 01:21:49,726
~ Come on, come on ~

1385
01:21:49,799 --> 01:21:51,459
~ Let's work together ~

1386
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:56,334
Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?

1387
01:21:56,403 --> 01:21:57,835
What's your problem?

1388
01:21:57,903 --> 01:21:59,336
What's his problem?

1389
01:21:59,405 --> 01:22:02,338
Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?

1390
01:22:02,406 --> 01:22:04,340
Is your friend
stupid or something?

1391
01:22:04,408 --> 01:22:05,841
What did you say?

1392
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:08,341
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

1393
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:09,672
Don't call him stupid!

1394
01:22:09,744 --> 01:22:11,176
Hey, don't push her!

1395
01:22:11,245 --> 01:22:12,269
You shut up!

1396
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:14,245
Don't you ever call him stupid!

1397
01:22:14,314 --> 01:22:16,645
Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?

1398
01:22:16,715 --> 01:22:17,875
Get your goddamned clothes

1399
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:20,382
and get the hell out of here!

1400
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,281
You should be in a sideshow.

1401
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:23,478
You're so pathetic!

1402
01:22:23,553 --> 01:22:25,041
Get out of here!

1403
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:26,552
You big guy!

1404
01:22:26,621 --> 01:22:28,588
Loser. You freak!

1405
01:22:33,358 --> 01:22:35,019
Oh, no. No.

1406
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,307
I'm sorry I ruined

1407
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:04,309
your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

1408
01:23:04,377 --> 01:23:06,708
She tastes like cigarettes.

1409
01:23:22,821 --> 01:23:24,755
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured</i>

1410
01:23:24,823 --> 01:23:27,756
<i>there's some things
you just can't change.</i>

1411
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:30,759
<i>He didn't want
to be called crippled</i>

1412
01:23:30,827 --> 01:23:34,261
<i>just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.</i>

1413
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:40,457
Happy new year, Gump.

1414
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:46,759
<i>The U.S. Ping-Pong team</i>

1415
01:23:46,836 --> 01:23:48,269
<i>met with President Nixon today...</i>

1416
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:49,962
Wouldn't you know it?

1417
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:51,766
A few months later,

1418
01:23:51,839 --> 01:23:54,773
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

1419
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:56,273
to visit the White House.

1420
01:23:56,341 --> 01:23:57,740
So I went...

1421
01:23:57,809 --> 01:23:58,968
Again.

1422
01:23:59,043 --> 01:24:02,842
And I met the president
of the United States again.

1423
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,472
<i>Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms</i>

1424
01:24:05,548 --> 01:24:07,276
<i>in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1425
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:08,780
<i>Are you enjoying yourself</i>

1426
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:10,783
<i>in our nation's capital,
young man?</i>

1427
01:24:10,851 --> 01:24:12,283
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

1428
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:13,783
<i>It's called the Hotel Ebbott.</i>

1429
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:16,787
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.</i>

1430
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,218
<i>It's brand-new. Very modern.</i>

1431
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:20,916
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it.</i>

1432
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,217
Security.

1433
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:23,723
Yeah. Sir,

1434
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,725
you might want to send
a maintenance man

1435
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:29,226
over to that office
across the way.

1436
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:30,727
The lights are off

1437
01:24:30,795 --> 01:24:33,730
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

1438
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:36,731
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1439
01:24:36,799 --> 01:24:38,733
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

1440
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:40,097
Thank you. Good night.

1441
01:24:43,304 --> 01:24:44,736
<i>Therefore...</i>

1442
01:24:44,804 --> 01:24:46,737
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

1443
01:24:46,805 --> 01:24:49,068
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1444
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,074
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1445
01:24:51,142 --> 01:24:53,233
<i>will be sworn in as president</i>

1446
01:24:53,309 --> 01:24:55,971
<i>at that hour in this office.</i>

1447
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:08,551
Forrest Gump.

1448
01:25:08,619 --> 01:25:10,245
Yes, sir!

1449
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,752
As you were.

1450
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,754
I have your discharge papers.

1451
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:15,482
Service is up, son.

1452
01:25:17,757 --> 01:25:21,054
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

1453
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,093
For the army, it does.

1454
01:25:25,262 --> 01:25:27,195
<i>And just like that,</i>

1455
01:25:27,263 --> 01:25:30,698
<i>my service in
the United States Army was over.</i>

1456
01:25:35,268 --> 01:25:37,236
<i>So I went home.</i>

1457
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:00,439
I'm home, Mama.

1458
01:26:00,516 --> 01:26:02,915
I know. I know.

1459
01:26:04,286 --> 01:26:05,718
Louise, he's here.

1460
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:08,720
<i>Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,</i>

1461
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:11,221
<i>but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.</i>

1462
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,223
We've had all sorts of visitors.

1463
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:16,726
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1464
01:26:16,793 --> 01:26:19,658
One man even left
a check for $25,000

1465
01:26:19,728 --> 01:26:23,163
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

1466
01:26:23,229 --> 01:26:26,164
I only like using
my own paddle.

1467
01:26:26,232 --> 01:26:27,631
Hi, Miss Louise.

1468
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,687
Hey, Forrest.

1469
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:31,667
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1470
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:35,170
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

1471
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:37,670
see if it grows on you.

1472
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:39,673
<i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1473
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:42,474
<i>It's funny how things work out.</i>

1474
01:26:42,607 --> 01:26:44,507
<i>I didn't stay home for long</i>

1475
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:47,008
<i>because I'd made
a promise to Bubba,</i>

1476
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,510
<i>and I always try
to keep my promise,</i>

1477
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:52,011
<i>so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre</i>

1478
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:53,569
<i>to meet Bubba's family.</i>

1479
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:58,048
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

1480
01:26:58,116 --> 01:27:01,346
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

1481
01:27:01,419 --> 01:27:02,351
I guess.

1482
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,851
<i>And, of course,</i>

1483
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:07,013
<i>I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.</i>

1484
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:10,917
Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.

1485
01:27:14,259 --> 01:27:16,193
I remember everything you said,

1486
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:19,127
and I got it all figured out.

1487
01:27:20,797 --> 01:27:27,427
I'm taking $24,562.47

1488
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:29,628
that I got, that's left

1489
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:32,135
<i>after a new haircut
and a new suit</i>

1490
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:35,138
<i>and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1491
01:27:35,206 --> 01:27:38,071
<i>and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1492
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,130
Tell me something.

1493
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,641
Are you stupid or something?

1494
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,405
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1495
01:27:45,478 --> 01:27:47,412
That's what's left
after me saying,

1496
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,414
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1497
01:27:51,482 --> 01:27:53,416
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

1498
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:55,609
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

1499
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:57,618
which everybody knows isn't true,

1500
01:27:57,686 --> 01:28:00,619
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

1501
01:28:00,687 --> 01:28:02,620
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1502
01:28:02,688 --> 01:28:05,122
So anyway, I'm putting all that

1503
01:28:05,191 --> 01:28:07,623
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1504
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:10,626
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1505
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,174
<i>Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1506
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:38,176
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1507
01:28:39,244 --> 01:28:41,803
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1508
01:28:43,747 --> 01:28:46,408
I only caught five.

1509
01:28:46,482 --> 01:28:49,917
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1510
01:28:51,752 --> 01:28:54,686
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

1511
01:28:54,754 --> 01:28:57,687
It's bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

1512
01:28:57,755 --> 01:29:00,189
<i>I'd never named a boat before,</i>

1513
01:29:00,257 --> 01:29:05,283
<i>but there was only one
I could think of,</i>

1514
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:09,317
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1515
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:14,887
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

1516
01:29:14,965 --> 01:29:16,933
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

1517
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,298
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

1518
01:29:21,369 --> 01:29:23,564
<i>~ Do a little dance ~</i>

1519
01:29:23,638 --> 01:29:25,399
<i>~ Make a little love ~</i>

1520
01:29:25,471 --> 01:29:27,098
<i>~ Get down tonight ~</i>

1521
01:29:27,173 --> 01:29:28,264
<i>~ Whoo ~</i>

1522
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,637
<i>~ Get down tonight... ~</i>

1523
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:32,107
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny</i>

1524
01:29:32,176 --> 01:29:33,472
<i>in a long while,</i>

1525
01:29:33,543 --> 01:29:35,977
<i>but I thought about her a lot.</i>

1526
01:29:36,046 --> 01:29:39,138
<i>I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1527
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:44,239
~ Oh, and the bird
you cannot change ~

1528
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:54,384
~ And this bird
you cannot change ~

1529
01:29:54,456 --> 01:30:01,825
~ Lord knows I can't change ~

1530
01:30:01,894 --> 01:30:08,820
~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~

1531
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,445
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1532
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,851
Hey!

1533
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:21,969
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1534
01:32:22,044 --> 01:32:25,410
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

1535
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,414
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1536
01:32:28,482 --> 01:32:29,914
Yes, I know that.

1537
01:32:29,982 --> 01:32:34,178
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

1538
01:32:34,251 --> 01:32:36,617
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

1539
01:32:36,687 --> 01:32:39,552
I had to see this for myself...

1540
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:42,322
And...

1541
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:46,825
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1542
01:32:46,892 --> 01:32:48,826
that I'd be your first mate.

1543
01:32:48,894 --> 01:32:50,554
Well, here I am.

1544
01:32:50,628 --> 01:32:52,561
I'm a man of my word.

1545
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:53,653
O.K.

1546
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:55,889
But don't you be thinking

1547
01:32:55,964 --> 01:32:58,398
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

1548
01:32:58,466 --> 01:32:59,398
No, sir.

1549
01:33:07,938 --> 01:33:09,461
It's my boat.

1550
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:16,736
I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1551
01:33:16,811 --> 01:33:20,370
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1552
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:23,213
Take a left!

1553
01:33:23,281 --> 01:33:24,212
Which way?

1554
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:25,213
Over there!

1555
01:33:25,282 --> 01:33:26,715
They're over there!

1556
01:33:26,784 --> 01:33:30,115
Get on the wheel
and take a left.

1557
01:33:30,185 --> 01:33:31,618
O.K.

1558
01:33:32,953 --> 01:33:34,887
Gump, what are you doing?

1559
01:33:34,955 --> 01:33:36,386
Take a left!

1560
01:33:36,455 --> 01:33:37,444
Left!

1561
01:33:39,324 --> 01:33:43,258
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1562
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:44,258
Ha ha!

1563
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,453
That's where we'll find them.

1564
01:33:58,869 --> 01:34:00,802
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1565
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,804
O.K., so I was wrong.

1566
01:34:02,872 --> 01:34:05,805
Well, how are we
going to find them?

1567
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:09,898
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1568
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:12,636
~ So pray that ~

1569
01:34:12,711 --> 01:34:15,975
~ I'm homeward bound... ~

1570
01:34:16,046 --> 01:34:18,741
<i>So I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1571
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:22,115
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1572
01:34:22,183 --> 01:34:26,050
<i>though I think he left
the praying up to me.</i>

1573
01:34:40,561 --> 01:34:41,960
No shrimp.

1574
01:34:43,063 --> 01:34:45,996
Where the hell's
this God of yours?

1575
01:34:46,064 --> 01:34:48,498
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that</i>

1576
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:52,435
<i>'cause right then God showed up.</i>

1577
01:35:08,076 --> 01:35:10,510
You'll never sink this boat!

1578
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,239
<i>Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1579
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:17,373
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1580
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,438
Come on!

1581
01:35:20,984 --> 01:35:23,281
You call this a storm?

1582
01:35:23,352 --> 01:35:27,287
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1583
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:31,289
It's time for a showdown!

1584
01:35:31,357 --> 01:35:32,824
You and me!

1585
01:35:32,892 --> 01:35:35,950
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

1586
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:38,551
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1587
01:35:38,628 --> 01:35:40,061
You'll never sink...

1588
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:41,426
This...

1589
01:35:41,497 --> 01:35:42,589
Boat!

1590
01:35:42,665 --> 01:35:44,598
Ha ha ha ha!

1591
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,800
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

1592
01:35:46,933 --> 01:35:48,729
destroying nearly
everything in its path.

1593
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:51,734
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1594
01:35:51,802 --> 01:35:54,600
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1595
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:57,002
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen</i>

1596
01:35:57,072 --> 01:35:59,904
<i>and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1597
01:35:59,974 --> 01:36:01,406
<i>This reporter has learned,</i>

1598
01:36:01,475 --> 01:36:03,908
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat</i>

1599
01:36:03,976 --> 01:36:05,499
<i>actually survived the storm.</i>

1600
01:36:05,577 --> 01:36:08,045
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1601
01:36:08,113 --> 01:36:11,205
<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

1602
01:36:11,281 --> 01:36:14,045
~ There will be great bounty ~

1603
01:36:14,117 --> 01:36:16,777
~ Oh, my God... ~

1604
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:18,785
<i>Since people still
needed them shrimps</i>

1605
01:36:18,852 --> 01:36:21,217
<i>for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all</i>

1606
01:36:21,287 --> 01:36:24,221
and we were the only boat
left standing,

1607
01:36:24,289 --> 01:36:26,722
Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.

1608
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:29,724
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1609
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:31,725
<i>12 Jennys, big old warehouse.</i>

1610
01:36:31,793 --> 01:36:33,726
We even have hats

1611
01:36:33,794 --> 01:36:36,228
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1612
01:36:36,297 --> 01:36:37,728
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1613
01:36:37,796 --> 01:36:39,229
It's a household name.

1614
01:36:39,298 --> 01:36:40,959
Hold on there, boy.

1615
01:36:41,033 --> 01:36:43,465
Are you telling me
you're the owner

1616
01:36:43,533 --> 01:36:45,763
of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?

1617
01:36:45,836 --> 01:36:48,769
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1618
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:51,771
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,

1619
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:54,773
but that tops them all.

1620
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:56,808
Ha ha ha ha!

1621
01:36:56,875 --> 01:37:00,274
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

1622
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:08,271
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1623
01:37:08,349 --> 01:37:11,407
and you tell it so well,

1624
01:37:11,483 --> 01:37:13,575
with such enthusiasm.

1625
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:17,745
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1626
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:20,050
Yes, I would.

1627
01:37:24,325 --> 01:37:25,952
That's him right there.

1628
01:37:28,194 --> 01:37:31,252
Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.

1629
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:32,819
Forrest...

1630
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,128
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1631
01:38:07,317 --> 01:38:09,750
<i>He never actually said so,</i>

1632
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:14,186
<i>but I think
he made his peace with God.</i>

1633
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,756
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1634
01:38:23,828 --> 01:38:26,260
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1635
01:38:26,328 --> 01:38:29,263
<i>Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.</i>

1636
01:38:29,331 --> 01:38:30,763
<i>Jenny 1. Go, Margo.</i>

1637
01:38:30,832 --> 01:38:32,765
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1638
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:37,268
Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.

1639
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:39,768
He is indisposed at the moment.

1640
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:41,304
<i>His mama's sick.</i>

1641
01:39:00,383 --> 01:39:01,314
Where's Mama?

1642
01:39:01,383 --> 01:39:03,180
She's upstairs.

1643
01:39:05,619 --> 01:39:07,347
Hi, Forrest.

1644
01:39:08,421 --> 01:39:09,615
I'll see you tomorrow.

1645
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:10,984
Oh, all right.

1646
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,191
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1647
01:39:32,369 --> 01:39:33,857
What's the matter, Mama?

1648
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:37,099
I'm dying, Forrest.

1649
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:42,139
Come on in, sit down over here.

1650
01:39:55,849 --> 01:39:57,975
Why are you dying, Mama?

1651
01:39:58,051 --> 01:40:00,143
It's my time.

1652
01:40:00,218 --> 01:40:03,277
It's just my time.

1653
01:40:03,354 --> 01:40:05,378
Oh, now...

1654
01:40:06,456 --> 01:40:09,014
Don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.

1655
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:12,491
Death is just a part of life.

1656
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,517
Something we're all
destined to do.

1657
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:18,926
I didn't know it,

1658
01:40:18,997 --> 01:40:21,931
but I was destined
to be your mama.

1659
01:40:21,999 --> 01:40:24,727
I did the best I could.

1660
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,734
You did good.

1661
01:40:26,802 --> 01:40:33,068
Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1662
01:40:33,138 --> 01:40:37,664
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1663
01:40:41,177 --> 01:40:43,770
What's my destiny, Mama?

1664
01:40:43,845 --> 01:40:48,280
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1665
01:40:49,614 --> 01:40:52,549
Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.

1666
01:40:52,617 --> 01:40:55,550
You never know what
you're going to get.

1667
01:40:55,618 --> 01:40:58,552
<i>Mama always had a way
of explaining things</i>

1668
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,553
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

1669
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:02,088
I will miss you, Forrest.

1670
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:06,087
<i>She had got the cancer</i>

1671
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:08,091
<i>and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1672
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,752
<i>I bought her a new hat</i>

1673
01:41:10,828 --> 01:41:12,852
<i>with little flowers on it.</i>

1674
01:41:15,798 --> 01:41:18,492
And that's all I have
to say about that.

1675
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:28,465
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?

1676
01:41:28,538 --> 01:41:31,267
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1677
01:41:34,775 --> 01:41:39,210
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1678
01:41:39,277 --> 01:41:42,212
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1679
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:43,712
and a college graduate,

1680
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:46,214
the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

1681
01:41:46,282 --> 01:41:48,772
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1682
01:41:50,284 --> 01:41:53,810
<i>So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1683
01:41:53,887 --> 01:41:56,821
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.</i>

1684
01:41:56,889 --> 01:41:59,823
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1685
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:02,323
<i>So then I got a call from him</i>

1686
01:42:02,392 --> 01:42:04,952
<i>saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,</i>

1687
01:42:05,028 --> 01:42:09,429
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1688
01:42:09,497 --> 01:42:11,293
~ I've got a new hope... ~

1689
01:42:11,364 --> 01:42:13,797
<i>Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune</i>

1690
01:42:13,866 --> 01:42:15,492
<i>a man really needs,</i>

1691
01:42:15,566 --> 01:42:18,966
<i>and the rest
is just for showing off.</i>

1692
01:42:19,036 --> 01:42:21,936
<i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i>

1693
01:42:22,004 --> 01:42:25,267
<i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i>

1694
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:30,400
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i>

1695
01:42:31,877 --> 01:42:34,310
<i>and even though Bubba was dead</i>

1696
01:42:34,378 --> 01:42:37,812
<i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1697
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,610
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1698
01:42:43,984 --> 01:42:45,645
You know what?

1699
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:49,653
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1700
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:52,310
That smells wonderful.

1701
01:42:52,385 --> 01:42:54,815
<i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i>

1702
01:42:54,884 --> 01:42:57,814
<i>and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1703
01:42:57,881 --> 01:43:01,311
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1704
01:43:02,744 --> 01:43:06,174
<i>But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do</i>

1705
01:43:06,242 --> 01:43:08,672
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1706
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:11,669
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1707
01:44:15,123 --> 01:44:18,916
<i>And then... she was there.</i>

1708
01:44:51,628 --> 01:44:52,923
Hello, Forrest.

1709
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:55,184
Hello, Jenny.

1710
01:45:06,018 --> 01:45:09,140
<i>Jenny came back
and stayed with me.</i>

1711
01:45:09,215 --> 01:45:12,144
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1712
01:45:12,963 --> 01:45:15,825
<i>or maybe it was because
she was so tired</i>

1713
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:18,194
<i>'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept</i>

1714
01:45:18,772 --> 01:45:20,221
<i>like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1715
01:45:22,209 --> 01:45:24,576
<i>It was wonderful
having her home.</i>

1716
01:45:24,646 --> 01:45:27,082
<i>Every day we'd take a walk,</i>

1717
01:45:27,151 --> 01:45:31,089
<i>and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1718
01:45:31,157 --> 01:45:34,093
<i>and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping</i>

1719
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:37,097
<i>and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.</i>

1720
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:39,101
<i>I did all the talking.</i>

1721
01:45:39,169 --> 01:45:41,661
<i>Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.</i>

1722
01:46:21,334 --> 01:46:24,065
How could you do this?

1723
01:47:01,395 --> 01:47:05,891
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1724
01:47:07,403 --> 01:47:10,341
<i>I never really knew
why she came back,</i>

1725
01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:11,842
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

1726
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,845
<i>It was like olden times.</i>

1727
01:47:13,913 --> 01:47:16,712
<i>We was like
peas and carrots again.</i>

1728
01:47:18,354 --> 01:47:20,790
<i>Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers</i>

1729
01:47:20,858 --> 01:47:24,421
<i>and put them in her room for her,</i>

1730
01:47:24,497 --> 01:47:27,935
<i>and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get</i>

1731
01:47:28,002 --> 01:47:29,436
<i>in the wide world.</i>

1732
01:47:29,505 --> 01:47:32,031
They're made just for running.

1733
01:47:32,108 --> 01:47:33,371
<i>~ Carry me home to see my kin ~</i>

1734
01:47:36,047 --> 01:47:38,574
<i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i>

1735
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,788
<i>~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~</i>

1736
01:47:42,858 --> 01:47:44,086
<i>~ And I think it's a sin ~</i>

1737
01:47:45,362 --> 01:47:47,024
<i>~ Sweet home Alabama... ~</i>

1738
01:47:47,098 --> 01:47:52,129
<i>Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...</i>

1739
01:47:55,043 --> 01:47:58,242
<i>and it was the happiest time
in my life.</i>

1740
01:48:22,452 --> 01:48:23,886
You done watching it?

1741
01:48:23,955 --> 01:48:24,887
Mm-hmm.

1742
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:26,948
I'm going to bed.

1743
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:39,434
Will you marry me?

1744
01:48:44,485 --> 01:48:47,455
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1745
01:48:49,994 --> 01:48:51,894
You would, Forrest.

1746
01:48:54,334 --> 01:48:56,097
But you won't marry me.

1747
01:48:58,506 --> 01:49:00,907
You don't want to marry me.

1748
01:49:04,015 --> 01:49:06,416
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1749
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:13,795
I'm not a smart man,

1750
01:49:13,863 --> 01:49:18,325
but I know what love is.

1751
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,523
Jenny...

1752
01:49:58,599 --> 01:50:00,897
Forrest, I do love you.

1753
01:50:53,949 --> 01:50:56,545
Where are you running off to?

1754
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:58,180
I'm not running.

1755
01:52:28,662 --> 01:52:30,631
<i>That day,</i>

1756
01:52:30,698 --> 01:52:32,133
<i>for no particular reason,</i>

1757
01:52:32,201 --> 01:52:35,194
<i>I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1758
01:52:35,272 --> 01:52:38,731
<i>So I ran to the end of the road,</i>

1759
01:52:38,811 --> 01:52:42,145
<i>and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.</i>

1760
01:52:42,215 --> 01:52:44,845
<i>President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...</i>

1761
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,912
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1762
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:50,928
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

1763
01:52:50,996 --> 01:52:53,432
<i>Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,</i>

1764
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,370
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1765
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,375
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1766
01:52:59,443 --> 01:53:01,435
<i>I ran clear across Alabama.</i>

1767
01:53:01,512 --> 01:53:06,042
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1768
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:08,055
I ran clear to the ocean.

1769
01:53:13,297 --> 01:53:14,890
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1770
01:53:14,966 --> 01:53:17,402
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far,</i>

1771
01:53:17,471 --> 01:53:20,635
<i>might as well turn around,
just keep on going.</i>

1772
01:53:22,678 --> 01:53:25,740
<i>And when I got to another ocean,</i>

1773
01:53:25,816 --> 01:53:28,752
<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far...</i>

1774
01:53:30,657 --> 01:53:32,955
<i>I might as well just turn back</i>

1775
01:53:33,027 --> 01:53:34,621
<i>and keep right on going.</i>

1776
01:53:34,697 --> 01:53:38,031
<i>When I got tired, I slept.</i>

1777
01:53:38,101 --> 01:53:40,195
<i>When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1778
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:42,707
When I had to go...

1779
01:53:42,776 --> 01:53:43,801
You know...

1780
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:46,105
I went.

1781
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,375
And so...

1782
01:53:47,449 --> 01:53:49,475
You just ran.

1783
01:53:51,121 --> 01:53:52,680
Yeah.

1784
01:53:52,757 --> 01:53:56,456
~ Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels ~

1785
01:53:59,635 --> 01:54:02,504
~ Lookin' back
at the years gone by ~

1786
01:54:02,573 --> 01:54:04,872
~ Like so many summer fields ~

1787
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:09,711
~ In '65, I was 17 ~

1788
01:54:09,783 --> 01:54:12,218
~ And runnin' up one on one ~

1789
01:54:13,656 --> 01:54:16,252
~ I don't know
where I'm runnin' now ~

1790
01:54:16,326 --> 01:54:19,422
~ I'm just runnin' on ~

1791
01:54:19,499 --> 01:54:21,262
~ Runnin' on ~

1792
01:54:21,334 --> 01:54:23,269
~ Runnin' on empty ~

1793
01:54:23,337 --> 01:54:24,737
~ Runnin' on ~

1794
01:54:24,807 --> 01:54:26,604
~ Runnin' dry ~

1795
01:54:26,676 --> 01:54:27,609
~ Runnin' on... ~

1796
01:54:27,678 --> 01:54:29,271
<i>I'd think a lot...</i>

1797
01:54:29,347 --> 01:54:33,615
<i>about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1798
01:54:33,687 --> 01:54:35,211
<i>But most of all,</i>

1799
01:54:35,288 --> 01:54:37,281
<i>I thought about Jenny.</i>

1800
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:40,124
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1801
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,192
<i>For more than two years,</i>

1802
01:54:43,268 --> 01:54:44,998
<i>a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1803
01:54:45,071 --> 01:54:48,064
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1804
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:50,408
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1805
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:52,573
<i>Charles Cooper
brings you this report.</i>

1806
01:54:52,649 --> 01:54:53,912
<i>For the fourth time</i>

1807
01:54:53,985 --> 01:54:55,578
<i>on his journey across America,</i>

1808
01:54:55,654 --> 01:54:58,089
<i>Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1809
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:00,924
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1810
01:55:00,996 --> 01:55:02,429
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1811
01:55:02,497 --> 01:55:04,432
<i>Sir, where are you running?</i>

1812
01:55:04,501 --> 01:55:06,935
Are you doing this
for world peace?

1813
01:55:07,004 --> 01:55:09,440
Are you doing this
for the homeless?

1814
01:55:09,508 --> 01:55:11,443
Are you running
for women's rights?

1815
01:55:11,511 --> 01:55:12,444
The environment?

1816
01:55:12,513 --> 01:55:13,776
<i>They just couldn't believe</i>

1817
01:55:13,849 --> 01:55:16,283
<i>that somebody would do
all that running</i>

1818
01:55:16,351 --> 01:55:17,786
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1819
01:55:17,855 --> 01:55:19,448
Why are you doing this?

1820
01:55:19,524 --> 01:55:21,789
I just felt like running.

1821
01:55:21,861 --> 01:55:23,489
I just felt like runnin'.

1822
01:55:24,565 --> 01:55:25,497
That's you.

1823
01:55:25,566 --> 01:55:28,162
I can't believe it's really you.

1824
01:55:28,237 --> 01:55:29,671
Now... for some reason,

1825
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:32,174
what I was doing seemed to...

1826
01:55:32,243 --> 01:55:33,768
Make sense to people.

1827
01:55:33,845 --> 01:55:36,782
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1828
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:39,877
I said, "Here's a guy
that's got his act together.

1829
01:55:39,955 --> 01:55:41,891
Here's somebody
who has the answer."

1830
01:55:41,959 --> 01:55:43,893
I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1831
01:55:43,961 --> 01:55:46,295
<i>So I got company.</i>

1832
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:50,395
<i>And after that,
I got more company.</i>

1833
01:55:50,471 --> 01:55:54,000
<i>And then, even
more people joined in.</i>

1834
01:55:56,012 --> 01:55:57,748
<i>Somebody later told me</i>

1835
01:55:57,881 --> 01:55:59,440
it gave people hope.

1836
01:56:01,018 --> 01:56:02,179
Now...

1837
01:56:02,254 --> 01:56:04,746
Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1838
01:56:04,824 --> 01:56:07,260
<i>but some of those people asked me</i>

1839
01:56:07,329 --> 01:56:09,263
<i>if I could help them out.</i>

1840
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:11,767
I was wondering
if you might help me.

1841
01:56:11,835 --> 01:56:13,770
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1842
01:56:13,838 --> 01:56:15,431
I need a good slogan,

1843
01:56:15,508 --> 01:56:17,444
and since you've
been so inspirational,

1844
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:20,107
I thought you might
be able to help me...

1845
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:21,946
Whoa, man! You just ran

1846
01:56:22,018 --> 01:56:24,317
through a big pile of dog shit!

1847
01:56:25,557 --> 01:56:27,150
It happens.

1848
01:56:27,226 --> 01:56:28,591
What, shit?

1849
01:56:29,663 --> 01:56:30,961
Sometimes.

1850
01:56:33,402 --> 01:56:35,871
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fella</i>

1851
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:38,204
<i>did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan</i>

1852
01:56:38,276 --> 01:56:41,543
<i>and made a lot of money
off of it.</i>

1853
01:56:41,614 --> 01:56:43,549
<i>Another time,
I was running along.</i>

1854
01:56:43,617 --> 01:56:46,554
<i>Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1855
01:56:46,622 --> 01:56:50,059
<i>he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,</i>

1856
01:56:50,127 --> 01:56:52,063
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,</i>

1857
01:56:52,131 --> 01:56:54,066
<i>and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1858
01:56:54,134 --> 01:56:57,572
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1859
01:57:01,879 --> 01:57:03,780
Have a nice day.

1860
01:57:05,384 --> 01:57:07,319
<i>Some years later, I found out</i>

1861
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:10,825
<i>that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1862
01:57:10,893 --> 01:57:13,055
<i>He made a lot of money.</i>

1863
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:17,334
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,</i>

1864
01:57:17,402 --> 01:57:20,339
<i>I had a lot of company.</i>

1865
01:57:20,407 --> 01:57:21,840
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1866
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:24,846
<i>"You got to put the past
behind you</i>

1867
01:57:24,914 --> 01:57:27,349
<i>before you can move on. "</i>

1868
01:57:27,417 --> 01:57:31,355
<i>And I think that's
what my running was all about.</i>

1869
01:57:32,759 --> 01:57:35,354
<i>I had run for three years...</i>

1870
01:57:35,429 --> 01:57:37,365
<i>two months...</i>

1871
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:39,528
<i>14 days, and 16 hours.</i>

1872
01:57:54,726 --> 01:57:57,219
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1873
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:10,774
I'm pretty tired.

1874
01:58:13,422 --> 01:58:15,517
Think I'll go home now.

1875
01:58:33,453 --> 01:58:36,048
<i>Now what are we supposed to do?</i>

1876
01:58:37,292 --> 01:58:38,884
<i>And just like that...</i>

1877
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:42,165
<i>my runnin'days was over.</i>

1878
01:58:43,568 --> 01:58:45,902
<i>So I went home to Alabama.</i>

1879
01:58:46,106 --> 01:58:48,336
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,</i>

1880
01:58:48,409 --> 01:58:50,844
<i>as President Reagan
was leaving the...</i>

1881
01:58:52,749 --> 01:58:54,684
<i>Five or six gunshots were fired</i>

1882
01:58:54,752 --> 01:58:56,687
<i>by an unknown, would-be assassin.</i>

1883
01:58:56,755 --> 01:58:59,191
<i>The president was
shot in the chest...</i>

1884
01:58:59,259 --> 01:59:00,851
I picked up the mail.

1885
01:59:00,927 --> 01:59:03,523
<i>And one day, out
of the blue clear sky,</i>

1886
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:05,795
<i>I got a letter from Jenny</i>

1887
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:08,305
wondering if I could
come down to Savannah

1888
01:59:08,373 --> 01:59:11,810
and see her, and that's
what I'm doing here.

1889
01:59:11,878 --> 01:59:12,811
Uh-huh.

1890
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:15,315
She saw me on TV... running.

1891
01:59:15,383 --> 01:59:19,879
I'm supposed to go on
the number 9 bus to Richmond Street

1892
01:59:19,956 --> 01:59:22,894
and get off and go one block left

1893
01:59:22,962 --> 01:59:25,396
to 1947 Henry Street...

1894
01:59:25,465 --> 01:59:26,728
Apartment 4.

1895
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:30,398
Why, you don't need
to take a bus.

1896
01:59:30,473 --> 01:59:34,411
Henry Street is just
five or six blocks...

1897
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:36,415
Down that way.

1898
01:59:36,483 --> 01:59:37,916
Down that way?

1899
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,418
Down that way.

1900
01:59:41,323 --> 01:59:43,656
It was nice talking to you.

1901
01:59:45,997 --> 01:59:48,432
I hope everything
works out for you!

1902
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:56,501
Hey!

1903
01:59:57,682 --> 01:59:59,775
Forrest!

1904
01:59:59,851 --> 02:00:01,616
How you doin'?

1905
02:00:01,688 --> 02:00:03,122
Come in! Come in!

1906
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:04,623
I got your letter.

1907
02:00:04,692 --> 02:00:06,628
Oh, I was wondering about that.

1908
02:00:08,532 --> 02:00:09,965
This your house?

1909
02:00:10,033 --> 02:00:11,626
Yeah. It's messy right now.

1910
02:00:11,703 --> 02:00:13,638
I just got off work.

1911
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:15,800
It's nice.

1912
02:00:15,877 --> 02:00:17,742
You got air-conditioning.

1913
02:00:20,717 --> 02:00:21,650
Uh...

1914
02:00:23,889 --> 02:00:25,152
Thank you.

1915
02:00:25,224 --> 02:00:26,657
I ate some.

1916
02:00:29,062 --> 02:00:33,798
I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook
of... of your clippings and...

1917
02:00:33,870 --> 02:00:35,771
Everything. There you are.

1918
02:00:37,743 --> 02:00:39,609
Yes, I got you running.

1919
02:00:41,682 --> 02:00:44,777
I ran a long way.

1920
02:00:44,853 --> 02:00:46,516
It's a long time.

1921
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:49,849
There...

1922
02:00:56,872 --> 02:00:59,467
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1923
02:00:59,542 --> 02:01:00,475
Um...

1924
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:03,981
I just...

1925
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:05,484
I want to apologize

1926
02:01:05,552 --> 02:01:09,490
for anything that I ever
did to you 'cause...

1927
02:01:09,558 --> 02:01:10,992
I was messed up...

1928
02:01:11,061 --> 02:01:12,653
For a long time, and...

1929
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:15,165
Yoo-hoo!

1930
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:16,167
Hey!

1931
02:01:16,236 --> 02:01:17,168
Hi.

1932
02:01:17,237 --> 02:01:18,170
Hey, you.

1933
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,674
This is my old friend
from Alabama.

1934
02:01:20,742 --> 02:01:22,335
How do you do?

1935
02:01:22,411 --> 02:01:25,870
Next week
my schedule changes, so I can...

1936
02:01:25,949 --> 02:01:28,385
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1937
02:01:28,454 --> 02:01:29,422
O.K. Thanks.

1938
02:01:32,093 --> 02:01:34,528
This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump.

1939
02:01:34,596 --> 02:01:35,859
Can you say hi?

1940
02:01:35,932 --> 02:01:37,366
Hello, Mr. Gump.

1941
02:01:37,434 --> 02:01:38,299
Hello.

1942
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:40,600
Can I go watch TV now?

1943
02:01:40,673 --> 02:01:42,505
Yes. Just keep it low.

1944
02:01:44,712 --> 02:01:46,476
You're a mama, Jenny.

1945
02:01:46,548 --> 02:01:48,015
I'm a mama.

1946
02:01:51,356 --> 02:01:52,789
His name's Forrest.

1947
02:01:54,227 --> 02:01:55,159
Like me!

1948
02:01:56,564 --> 02:01:58,998
I named him after his daddy.

1949
02:02:00,236 --> 02:02:04,004
He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?

1950
02:02:04,075 --> 02:02:05,509
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1951
02:02:20,434 --> 02:02:22,027
Hey...

1952
02:02:22,103 --> 02:02:23,537
Forrest, look at me.

1953
02:02:23,605 --> 02:02:26,074
Look at me, Forrest.

1954
02:02:28,112 --> 02:02:30,047
There's nothing you need to do.

1955
02:02:30,115 --> 02:02:32,050
You didn't do anything wrong.

1956
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:34,052
O.K.?

1957
02:02:38,561 --> 02:02:40,292
Isn't he beautiful?

1958
02:02:41,566 --> 02:02:44,503
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1959
02:02:48,577 --> 02:02:49,509
But...

1960
02:02:53,083 --> 02:02:55,519
Is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1961
02:02:55,588 --> 02:02:57,180
He's very smart.

1962
02:02:57,256 --> 02:03:00,455
He's one of
the smartest in his class.

1963
02:03:09,108 --> 02:03:11,703
Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him.

1964
02:03:21,126 --> 02:03:22,560
What are you watching?

1965
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:24,063
Bert and Ernie.

1966
02:03:47,098 --> 02:03:48,293
Forrest...

1967
02:03:50,269 --> 02:03:51,601
I'm sick.

1968
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:57,547
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1969
02:03:57,615 --> 02:04:01,052
I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,

1970
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,055
they don't know what it is,

1971
02:04:03,123 --> 02:04:06,218
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1972
02:04:10,968 --> 02:04:13,062
You could come home with me.

1973
02:04:14,808 --> 02:04:16,401
Jenny, you and...

1974
02:04:16,477 --> 02:04:17,409
Little Forrest

1975
02:04:17,478 --> 02:04:18,912
could come stay

1976
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:21,280
at my house in Greenbow.

1977
02:04:24,656 --> 02:04:27,752
I'll take care of you
if you're sick.

1978
02:04:29,997 --> 02:04:32,091
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1979
02:04:38,009 --> 02:04:38,977
O.K.

1980
02:04:40,146 --> 02:04:41,878
Please take your seats.

1981
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:46,722
Forrest?

1982
02:04:46,795 --> 02:04:48,459
It's time to start.

1983
02:05:07,341 --> 02:05:08,275
Hi.

1984
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:10,847
Your tie.

1985
02:05:23,613 --> 02:05:25,879
Lieutenant Dan.

1986
02:05:40,685 --> 02:05:42,314
Lieutenant Dan.

1987
02:05:43,524 --> 02:05:45,016
Hello, Forrest.

1988
02:05:45,095 --> 02:05:47,623
You got new legs.

1989
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:49,637
New legs!

1990
02:05:49,705 --> 02:05:52,803
Yeah. I got new legs.

1991
02:05:52,879 --> 02:05:54,143
Custom-made.

1992
02:05:54,216 --> 02:05:55,310
Titanium alloy.

1993
02:05:55,386 --> 02:05:58,484
It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1994
02:06:02,234 --> 02:06:03,864
Magic legs.

1995
02:06:05,742 --> 02:06:06,675
This...

1996
02:06:07,747 --> 02:06:09,273
Is my fiancée.

1997
02:06:09,351 --> 02:06:10,284
Susan.

1998
02:06:12,758 --> 02:06:15,321
Lieutenant Dan.

1999
02:06:15,397 --> 02:06:17,493
Hi, Forrest.

2000
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,040
Lieutenant Dan...

2001
02:06:20,108 --> 02:06:21,703
This is my Jenny.

2002
02:06:21,779 --> 02:06:25,048
Hi. It's nice
to meet you finally.

2003
02:06:35,343 --> 02:06:37,906
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

2004
02:06:37,982 --> 02:06:39,452
to be your wife?

2005
02:06:41,257 --> 02:06:43,694
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

2006
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:45,358
to be your husband?

2007
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:50,399
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

2008
02:07:21,182 --> 02:07:23,477
Hi.

2009
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:37,951
Hey, Forrest...

2010
02:07:43,332 --> 02:07:45,826
Were you scared in Vietnam?

2011
02:07:47,175 --> 02:07:48,941
Yes.

2012
02:07:49,013 --> 02:07:50,606
Well, l...

2013
02:07:50,683 --> 02:07:52,813
I don't know.

2014
02:07:52,888 --> 02:07:54,949
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining</i>

2015
02:07:55,026 --> 02:07:58,431
<i>long enough for
the stars to come out...</i>

2016
02:08:01,374 --> 02:08:03,310
<i>and then it was nice.</i>

2017
02:08:06,587 --> 02:08:09,650
It was like just
before the sun goes to bed

2018
02:08:09,726 --> 02:08:11,128
down on the bayou.

2019
02:08:11,197 --> 02:08:15,936
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water...</i>

2020
02:08:17,745 --> 02:08:19,875
<i>like that mountain lake.</i>

2021
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:21,886
<i>It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

2022
02:08:21,954 --> 02:08:24,893
<i>it looked like
there were two skies</i>

2023
02:08:24,962 --> 02:08:26,897
<i>one on top of the other.</i>

2024
02:08:28,603 --> 02:08:31,974
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

2025
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:35,884
<i>I couldn't tell</i>

2026
02:08:35,953 --> 02:08:41,763
<i>where heaven stopped
and the earth began.</i>

2027
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:45,233
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

2028
02:08:49,317 --> 02:08:52,348
I wish I could've
been there with you.

2029
02:08:55,598 --> 02:08:57,591
You were.

2030
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:09,557
I love you.

2031
02:09:13,639 --> 02:09:16,771
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

2032
02:09:18,651 --> 02:09:22,752
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

2033
02:09:27,171 --> 02:09:30,611
And I had that house
of your father's

2034
02:09:30,678 --> 02:09:32,946
bulldozed to the ground.

2035
02:09:36,191 --> 02:09:37,387
<i>Mama...</i>

2036
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:40,467
always said

2037
02:09:40,535 --> 02:09:44,636
that dyin' was a part of life.

2038
02:09:47,216 --> 02:09:48,982
I sure wish it wasn't.

2039
02:09:52,395 --> 02:09:53,921
Little Forrest is...

2040
02:09:55,235 --> 02:09:57,502
Doing just fine.

2041
02:09:57,574 --> 02:09:58,564
"But..."

2042
02:09:58,642 --> 02:10:01,079
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

2043
02:10:01,148 --> 02:10:03,176
<i>and...</i>

2044
02:10:03,253 --> 02:10:06,522
<i>and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner</i>

2045
02:10:06,594 --> 02:10:07,654
every day.

2046
02:10:09,435 --> 02:10:11,028
I make sure he...

2047
02:10:12,441 --> 02:10:13,877
Combs his hair

2048
02:10:13,945 --> 02:10:16,040
and brushes his teeth every day.

2049
02:10:18,288 --> 02:10:20,851
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

2050
02:10:23,132 --> 02:10:24,567
<i>He's really good.</i>

2051
02:10:24,636 --> 02:10:26,732
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2052
02:10:26,807 --> 02:10:27,866
Uhh!

2053
02:10:31,318 --> 02:10:32,752
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

2054
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:38,531
And every night,
we read a book.

2055
02:10:38,601 --> 02:10:40,036
He's so smart, Jenny.

2056
02:10:43,111 --> 02:10:45,207
You'd be so proud of him.

2057
02:10:46,954 --> 02:10:48,218
I am.

2058
02:10:49,627 --> 02:10:52,793
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

2059
02:10:54,136 --> 02:10:57,075
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

2060
02:10:57,143 --> 02:11:00,081
so I'll just leave it
here for you.

2061
02:11:16,354 --> 02:11:18,291
Jenny...

2062
02:11:23,202 --> 02:11:26,141
I don't know if Mama was right

2063
02:11:26,209 --> 02:11:29,307
or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.

2064
02:11:29,383 --> 02:11:31,250
I don't know...

2065
02:11:32,389 --> 02:11:35,055
If we each have a...

2066
02:11:36,231 --> 02:11:37,359
Destiny...

2067
02:11:38,838 --> 02:11:42,609
Or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

2068
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:44,115
on a breeze...

2069
02:11:48,361 --> 02:11:50,297
But l... I think...

2070
02:11:52,202 --> 02:11:53,967
Maybe it's both.

2071
02:11:58,216 --> 02:12:01,451
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

2072
02:12:07,236 --> 02:12:09,173
But I miss you, Jenny.

2073
02:12:15,756 --> 02:12:17,749
If there's anything you need...

2074
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:20,866
I won't be far away.

2075
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,717
Here's your bus.

2076
02:12:57,785 --> 02:12:59,152
O.K.

2077
02:12:59,222 --> 02:13:01,716
Hey...

2078
02:13:01,794 --> 02:13:03,229
I know this.

2079
02:13:03,298 --> 02:13:05,736
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

2080
02:13:05,803 --> 02:13:08,971
because Grandma used
to read it to you.

2081
02:13:09,045 --> 02:13:11,106
My favorite book.

2082
02:13:14,591 --> 02:13:16,025
Here we are.

2083
02:13:16,094 --> 02:13:17,427
Hey...

2084
02:13:19,334 --> 02:13:20,770
Here you go.

2085
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:27,511
Hey, Forrest...

2086
02:13:27,588 --> 02:13:29,056
Don't...

2087
02:13:31,863 --> 02:13:34,391
I want to tell you I love you.

2088
02:13:34,469 --> 02:13:36,440
I love you, too, Daddy.

2089
02:13:36,507 --> 02:13:39,378
I'll be right here
when you get back.

2090
02:13:44,827 --> 02:13:48,267
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

2091
02:13:48,334 --> 02:13:52,105
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
