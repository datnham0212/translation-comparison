1 Hello. My name's Forrest... Forrest Gump.
2 Do you want a chocolate?
3 I could eat about a million and a half of these.
4 My mama always said
5 life was like a box of chocolates.
6 You never know what you're going to get.
7 Those must be comfortable shoes.
8 I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that
9 and not feel a thing.
10 I wish I had shoes like that.
11 My feet hurt.
12 Mama always said there's an awful lot
13 you can tell about a person by their shoes.
14 Where they're going,
15 where they've been.
16 I've worn lots of shoes.
17 I bet if I think about it real hard
18 I could remember my first pair of shoes.
19 Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
20 She said they was my magic shoes.
21 All right, Forrest, open your eyes now.
22 Let's take a little walk around.
23 How do those feel?
24 His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,
25 as strong as I've ever seen.
26 But his back's as crooked as a politician.
27 But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest?
28 Forrest!
29 Now, when I was a baby,
30 Mama named me after the great Civil War hero
31 General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
32 She said we was related to him in some way.
33 What he did was,
34 he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.
35 They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets
36 and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.
37 They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around.
38 And, anyway, that's how I got my name... Forrest Gump.
39 Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me
40 that sometimes we all do things that, well,
41 that just don't make no sense.
42 This way. Hold on. Ugh!
43 All right.
44 What are y'all staring at?
45 Haven't you ever seen
46 a little boy with braces on his legs before?
47 Don't ever let anybody
48 tell you they're better than you, Forrest.
49 If God intended everybody to be the same,
50 he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
51 Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
52 We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,
53 about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.
54 That's in the county of Greenbow.
55 Our house had been in Mama's family
56 since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa
57 had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.
58 Since it was just me and Mama
59 and we had all these empty rooms,
60 Mama decided to let those rooms out,
61 mostly to people passing through,
62 like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.
63 That's how me and Mama got money.
64 Mama was a real smart lady.
65 Remember what I told you, Forrest.
66 You're no different than anybody else is.
67 Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
68 You're the same as everybody else.
69 You are no different.
70 Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
71 His I.Q. Is 75.
72 Well, we're all different,
73 Mr. Hancock.
74 She wanted me to have the finest education
75 so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.
76 I met the principal and all.
77 I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.
78 Now, this is normal.
79 Forrest is right here.
80 The state requires a minimum I.Q. Of 80
81 to attend public school.
82 Mrs. Gump,
83 he's going to have to go to a special school.
84 Now, he'll be just fine.
85 What does normal mean anyway?
86 He might be...
87 A bit on the slow side,
88 but my boy Forrest
89 is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.
90 He's not going to some special school
91 to learn how to retread tires.
92 We're talking about five little points here.
93 There must be something can be done.
94 We're a progressive school system.
95 We don't want to see anybody left behind.
96 Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
97 He's on vacation.
98 Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
99 Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
100 Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.
101 Mmm-mmm-mmm.
102 You don't say much, do you?
103 Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
104 Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
105 "Finally, he had to try.
106 "It looked easy, but...
107 Oh, what happened. First they..."
108 Mama, what's vacation mean?
109 Vacation?
110 Where Daddy went?
111 Vacation's when you go somewhere...
112 And you don't ever come back.
113 Anyway, I guess you could say
114 me and Mama was on our own.
115 But we didn't mind.
116 Our house was never empty.
117 There was always folks coming and going.
118 Supper!
119 It's supper, everyone!
120 That sure looks special.
121 Sometimes, we had so many people staying with us
122 that every room was filled, with travelers, you know,
123 folks living out of their suitcases
124 and hat cases and sample cases.
125 Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?
126 One time, a young man was staying with us,
127 and he had him a guitar case.
128 ~ Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit ~
129 ~ And you ain't no ~
130 ~ Friend of mine ~
131 Forrest,
132 I told you not to bother this nice young man.
133 No, that's all right, ma'am.
134 I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar.
135 All right. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat.
136 Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.
137 Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you did there.
138 Slow it down some.
139 ~ You ain't nothing but... ~
140 I liked that guitar.
141 It sounded good.
142 I started moving around to the music,
143 swinging my hips.
144 ~ Cryin' all the time ~
145 This one night,
146 me and Mama was out shopping,
147 and we walked by Vincy's Furniture and Appliance Store,
148 and guess what?
149 ~ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog ~
150 ~ Cryin'all the time ~
151 ~ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog ~
152 This is not for children's eyes.
153 ~ Cryin'all the time ~
154 Some years later,
155 that handsome young man who they called the King,
156 well, he sung too many songs.
157 Had himself a heart attack or something.
158 It must be hard being a king.
159 You know, it's funny how you remember some things,
160 but some things you can't.
161 You do your very best now, Forrest.
162 I sure will, Mama.
163 I remember the bus ride on the first day of school
164 very well.
165 Are you coming along?
166 Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
167 This is the bus to school.
168 I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.
169 I'm Dorothy Harris.
170 Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.
171 This seat's taken.
172 It's taken.
173 You can't sit here.
174 You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,
175 'cause I don't remember being born.
176 I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,
177 and I don't know
178 when I went on my first outdoor picnic,
179 but I do remember
180 the first time I heard the sweetest voice
181 in the wide world.
182 You can sit here if you want.
183 I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
184 She was like an angel.
185 Well, are you going to sit down or aren't you?
186 What's wrong with your legs?
187 Um, nothing at all, thank you.
188 My legs are just fine and dandy.
189 I just sat next to her on that bus
190 and had a conversation all the way to school.
191 My back's crooked like a question mark.
192 Next to Mama, no one ever talked to me
193 or asked me questions.
194 Are you stupid or something?
195 Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."
196 I'm Jenny.
197 I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.
198 From that day on, we was always together.
199 Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.
200 She taught me how to climb.
201 Come on, Forrest, you can do it.
202 I showed her how to dangle.
203 "A good little..."
204 She helped me learn how to read,
205 and I showed her how to swing.
206 Sometimes, we'd just sit out
207 and wait for the stars.
208 Mama's going to worry about me.
209 Just stay a little longer.
210 For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.
211 O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.
212 She was my most special friend.
213 My only friend.
214 Now, my mama always told me
215 that miracles happen every day.
216 Some people don't think so,
217 but they do.
218 Hey, dummy!
219 Are you dumb, or just plain stupid?
220 Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.
221 Just run away, Forrest.
222 Run, Forrest!
223 Run away! Hurry!
224 Get the bikes!
225 Let's get him! Come on!
226 Look out, Gump!
227 We're going to get you!
228 Run, Forrest, run!
229 Run, Forrest!
230 Come back here, you!
231 Ha ha ha ha ha!
232 Run, Forrest!
233 Run!
234 Now, you wouldn't believe if I told you...
235 but I could run like the wind blows.
236 From that day on,
237 if I was going somewhere,
238 I was running.
239 That boy sure is a running fool.
240 Now, remember how I told you
241 that Jenny never seemed to want to go home?
242 She lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.
243 Her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5,
244 and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.
245 Jenny?
246 He was a very loving man.
247 He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.
248 And then this one time,
249 Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.
250 Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?
251 Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.
252 Jenny!
253 Come on!
254 Jenny, where'd you run to?
255 You better get back here, girl!
256 Where you at?
257 Jenny!
258 Jenny, where you at?
259 Jenny!
260 Pray with me, Forrest.
261 Pray with me.
262 Jenny!
263 Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,
264 far, far away from here.
265 Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far.
266 Mama always said God is mysterious.
267 Jenny!
268 He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.
269 Instead,
270 he had the police say
271 Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.
272 She was to live with her grandma,
273 just over on Creekmore Avenue,
274 which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.
275 Some nights,
276 Jenny'd sneak out
277 and come on over to my house,
278 just 'cause she said she was scared.
279 Scared of what, I don't know.
280 But I think it was her grandma's dog.
281 He was a mean dog.
282 Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends
283 all the way up through high school.
284 Hey, stupid!
285 Quit it!
286 Run, Forrest, run!
287 Hey,
288 didn't you hear me, stupid?
289 Run, Forrest!
290 Get in the truck!
291 Come on! He's getting away! Move it!
292 Run, Forrest! Run!
293 Ha, ha!
294 Move it! Move it!
295 You better be runnin'!
296 Yeah!
297 - Whoo-hoo! - Go!
298 Run, Forrest!
299 Now, it used to be
300 I ran to get where I was going.
301 I never thought it would take me anywhere.
302 Ohh!
303 Who in the hell is that?
304 That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.
305 Just a local idiot.
306 And can you believe it?
307 I got to go to college, too.
308 Forrest, move it!
309 Run!
310 O.K.!
311 Run!
312 Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!
313 Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!
314 Run! Run! Go!
315 He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive,
316 but he sure is fast.
317 Now, maybe it's just me,
318 but college was very confusing times.
319 Federal troops, enforcing a court order,
320 integrated the University of Alabama today.
321 Two Negroes were admitted,
322 but only after Governor George Wallace
323 had carried out his symbolic threat
324 to stand in the schoolhouse door.
325 I take it from that statement...
326 Earl, what's going on?
327 Coons are trying to get into school.
328 Coons? When raccoons tried getting on our back porch,
329 Mama just chased them off with a broom.
330 Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.
331 And they want to go to school with us.
332 With us? They do?
333 Shortly after Governor Wallace
334 had carried out his promise to block the doorway,
335 Kennedy ordered the secretary of defense to use military force.
336 Here, by videotape, is the encounter
337 by General Graham, commander of the National Guard,
338 and Governor Wallace.
339 Because these National Guardsmen
340 are here today as federal soldiers for Alabama,
341 and they live within our borders.
342 They are our brothers.
343 We are winning in this fight,
344 because we are awakening the American people
345 to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times
346 that is so evident today...
347 A trend toward military dictatorship in this country.
348 And so, at day's end,
349 the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,
350 and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone
351 had been signed up for summer classes.
352 Ma'am, you dropped your book.
353 Ma'am.
354 Governor Wallace did what he promised.
355 By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob...
356 Say, wasn't that Gump?
357 Naw, that couldn't be.
358 It sure as hell was.
359 A few years later,
360 that angry little man at the schoolhouse door
361 thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.
362 But somebody thought that it wasn't.
363 But he didn't die.
364 My bus is here.
365 Is it the number 9?
366 No, it's the number 4.
367 It was nice talking to you.
368 I remember when that happened,
369 when Wallace got shot.
370 I was in college.
371 Did you go to a girls' college
372 or a girls' and boys' together college?
373 It was coed.
374 'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.
375 It was a college just for girls.
376 But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.
377 ~ I don't know why I love you ~
378 ~ But I do ~
379 ~ I don't know why I cry so ~
380 ~ But I do ~
381 ~ I only know I know that... ~
382 Ohh!
383 That hurts.
384 ~ But I don't know why I love you ~
385 ~ But I do ~
386 Forrest!
387 Forrest, stop it!
388 Stop it!
389 What are you doing?
390 He was hurting you.
391 No, he wasn't!
392 Get over there!
393 Billy, I'm sorry.
394 Just keep away from me.
395 Don't be such... Don't go.
396 Billy, wait a second.
397 He doesn't know any better.
398 Forrest, why'd you do that?
399 I brought you some chocolate.
400 I'm sorry.
401 I'll go back to my college now.
402 Forrest...
403 Look at you.
404 Come on.
405 Is this your own room?
406 Shh!
407 Do you ever dream, Forrest...
408 About who you're going to be?
409 Who I'm going to be?
410 Yeah.
411 Aren't I going to be me?
412 You'll always be you,
413 just another kind of you.
414 You know?
415 I want to be famous.
416 I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
417 I just want to be...
418 On an empty stage
419 with my guitar, my voice.
420 Just me.
421 And I want to reach people on a personal level.
422 I want to be able to say things,
423 just one to one.
424 Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?
425 I sit next to them
426 in my home economics class all the time.
427 Oh...
428 Oh, I'm sorry.
429 It's O.K.
430 Sorry.
431 Oh...
432 Oh...
433 It's all right.
434 It's O.K.
435 Oh, I'm dizzy.
436 I'll bet that never happened in home ec.
437 No.
438 I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
439 I don't care. I don't like her anyway.
440 Run! Run! Run! Run!
441 Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
442 Stop! Stop! Stop!
443 College ran by real fast
444 'cause I played so much football.
445 They even put me on a thing
446 called the all-America team
447 where you get to meet
448 the president of the United States.
449 President Kennedy met
450 with the collegiate all-American football team
451 at the Oval Office today.
452 Now the really good thing
453 about meeting the president of the United States
454 is the food.
455 They put you in this little room
456 with just about anything you'd want to eat or drink.
457 But since, number one,
458 I wasn't hungry but thirsty,
459 and number two, they was free,
460 I must have drank me about 15 Dr. Peppers.
461 How does it feel to be an all-American?
462 It's an honor, sir.
463 How does it feel to be an all-American?
464 Very good, sir.
465 How does it feel to be an all-American?
466 Very good, sir.
467 Congratulations. How do you feel?
468 I got to pee.
469 I believe he said he had to pee.
470 Some time later, for no particular reason,
471 somebody shot that nice young president
472 when he was riding in his car.
473 And a few years after that,
474 somebody shot his little brother, too,
475 only he was in a hotel kitchen.
476 Must be hard being brothers.
477 I wouldn't know.
478 Forrest Gump.
479 Now can you believe it?
480 After only five years of playing football,
481 I got a college degree.
482 Congratulations, son.
483 Mama was so proud.
484 Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
485 I'll hold this for you.
486 Congratulations, son.
487 Have you given any thought to your future?
488 Thought?
489 Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
490 Nobody gives a horse's shit
491 who you are, pus ball!
492 You're not even a lowlife, scum-sucking maggot!
493 Get your maggoty ass on the bus!
494 You're in the army now!
495 Seat's taken.
496 Taken.
497 At first it seemed like I made a mistake.
498 It was only my induction day,
499 and I was getting yelled at.
500 Sit down if you want to.
501 I didn't know who I might meet
502 or what they might ask.
503 You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
504 No.
505 But I been on a real big boat.
506 I'm talking about a shrimp catching boat.
507 I been working on shrimp boats all my life.
508 I started out on my uncle's boat
509 when I was about maybe 9.
510 I was just looking into buying my own boat
511 and got drafted.
512 My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
513 People call me Bubba,
514 just like one of them old redneck boys.
515 Can you believe that?
516 My name's Forrest Gump.
517 People call me Forrest Gump.
518 So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,
519 and his mama cooked shrimp.
520 And her mama before her cooked shrimp,
521 and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too.
522 Bubba's family knew everything
523 there was to know about the shrimping business.
524 I know everything there is to know
525 about the shrimping business.
526 I'm going into the shrimping business for myself
527 after I get out of the army.
528 O.K.
529 Gump!
530 What's your sole purpose in this army?
531 To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!
532 God damn it, Gump, you're a goddamn genius.
533 That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.
534 You must have a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.
535 You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.
536 Listen up, people!
537 Now for some reason, I fit in the army
538 like one of them round pegs.
539 It's not really hard.
540 You just make your bed neat,
541 remember to stand up straight,
542 and always answer every question
543 with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."
544 Is that clear?
545 Yes, Drill Sergeant!
546 What you do is drag your nets along the bottom.
547 On a good day,
548 you can catch over a hundred pounds of shrimp.
549 Everything goes all right,
550 2 men shrimping 10 hours,
551 less what you spends on gas...
552 Done, Drill Sergeant!
553 Gump!
554 Why did you put that weapon together so quickly?
555 You told me to, Drill Sergeant.
556 Jesus H. Christ.
557 This is a new company record.
558 If it wasn't a waste
559 of a fine enlisted man,
560 I'd recommend you for O.C.S., Private Gump.
561 You're going to be a general someday!
562 Now disassemble your weapon and continue!
563 Anyway, like I was saying,
564 shrimp is the fruit of the sea.
565 You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it,
566 bake it, sauté it.
567 They's, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,
568 shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried,
569 stir fried.
570 There's pineapple shrimp
571 and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,
572 pepper shrimp,
573 shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
574 shrimp salad,
575 shrimp in potatoes,
576 shrimp burger,
577 shrimp sandwich.
578 That... That's about it.
579 Nighttime in the army is a lonely time.
580 We'd lay there in our bunks,
581 and I'd miss my mama,
582 and I'd miss Jenny.
583 Hey, Gump.
584 Get a load of the tits on her.
585 Turns out...
586 Jenny had gotten into some trouble
587 over some photos of her in her college sweater.
588 And she was thrown out of school.
589 ~ My baby does the hanky panky ~
590 But that wasn't a bad thing,
591 'cause a man who owns a theater
592 in Memphis, Tennessee,
593 saw those photos
594 and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.
595 The first chance I got,
596 I took the bus up to Memphis
597 to see her perform in that show.
598 That was Amber, Amber Flame.
599 Give her a big hand.
600 And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure,
601 direct from Hollywood, California,
602 our very own beatnik beauty.
603 Let's give a big round of applause
604 to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.
605 ~ How many roads must a man walk down ~
606 ~ Before you can call him a man? ~
607 ~ Yes, and how many seas must the white dove sail ~
608 Her dream had come true.
609 ~ Before she sleeps in the sand? ~
610 She was a folksinger.
611 ~ Yes, and how many times ~
612 ~ Must the cannonballs fly ~
613 ~ Before they're forever banned? ~
614 Shake it up now.
615 Somebody get her a harmonica.
616 ~ The answer, my friend ~
617 ~ ls blowin' in the wind ~
618 This ain't Captain Kangaroo.
619 Hey, honey, I got something here for you.
620 Hey! God damn it!
621 Hey, you stupid jerk!
622 I'm singing a song here.
623 Polly, get out here!
624 Shut up yourself!
625 Just shut up!
626 Forrest! What are you doing here?
627 What are you doing?
628 - Hey! - Aw!
629 What are you doing, Forrest?
630 Let me down!
631 - Oh! Ooh! - Ooh!
632 Ha ha ha!
633 You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
634 You can't keep trying to rescue me.
635 They was trying to grab you.
636 A lot of people try to grab me.
637 Just... You can't keep doing this all the time.
638 I can't help it. I love you.
639 Forrest...
640 You don't know what love is.
641 You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?
642 We prayed for God to turn me into a bird
643 so I could fly far away.
644 Yes, I do.
645 You think I could fly off this bridge?
646 What do you mean, Jenny?
647 Nothing.
648 I got to get out of here.
649 Wait, Jenny.
650 Forrest, you stay away from me, O.K.?
651 You stay away from me, please.
652 Can I have a ride?
653 Where are you going?
654 I don't care.
655 Get in the truck.
656 So bye-bye, Jenny.
657 They sending me to Vietnam.
658 It's this whole other country.
659 Just hang on a minute.
660 Listen, you promise me something, O.K.?
661 Just if you're ever in trouble,
662 don't be brave.
663 You just run, O.K.? Just run away.
664 O.K.
665 Jenny.
666 I'll write you all the time.
667 And just like that, she was gone.
668 You come back safe to me.
669 Do you hear?
670 ~ Some folks are born ~
671 ~ Made to wave the flag ~
672 ~ Ooh, they're red, white, and blue ~
673 ~ And when the band plays "Hail To The Chief" ~
674 ~ Ooh, they'll point the cannon at you ~
675 ~ it ain't me ~
676 ~ I ain't no senator's son ~
677 ~ it ain't me ~
678 Now they told us
679 that Vietnam was going to be very different
680 from the United States of America.
681 Except for all the beer cans and barbecues,
682 it was.
683 Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp all in these waters.
684 They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp.
685 After we win this war
686 and we take over everything,
687 we can get American shrimpers out here
688 and shrimp these waters.
689 Just shrimp all the time, man.
690 You must be my FNGs.
691 Morning, sir.
692 Oh, get your hands down.
693 Do not salute me.
694 There are goddamn snipers all around this area
695 who'd love to grease an officer.
696 I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fort Platoon.
697 What's wrong with your lip?
698 I was born with big gums, sir.
699 Well, you better tuck that in.
700 Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.
701 Where are you boys from in the world?
702 - Alabama, sir! - Alabama, sir!
703 You twins?
704 No. We are not relations, sir.
705 Look,
706 it's pretty basic here.
707 You stick with me
708 and learn from the guys
709 who've been in country a while,
710 you'll be all right.
711 There is one item of G.I. Gear
712 that can be the difference between life and death...
713 Socks.
714 Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.
715 Try and keep your feet dry.
716 When we're out humpin', change your socks
717 whenever we stop.
718 The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
719 right off his legs.
720 Sergeant Sims. God damn it,
721 where's that sling rope I said to order?
722 I put in the requisitions.
723 Well, you call those sons of bitches...
724 Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
725 I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.
726 He was from a long, great military tradition.
727 Somebody in his family had fought
728 and died
729 in every...
730 single...
731 American war.
732 God damn it, kick some ass.
733 Get on it!
734 I guess you could say
735 he had a lot to live up to.
736 So, you boys from Arkansas, huh?
737 Well,
738 I been through there.
739 Little Rock's a fine town.
740 Now, shake down your gear.
741 See the platoon sergeant.
742 Draw what you need for the field.
743 If you boys are hungry,
744 we got steaks burning right over here.
745 Two standing orders in this platoon...
746 1... take care of your feet,
747 2... try not to do anything stupid,
748 like getting yourself killed.
749 I sure hope I don't let him down.
750 I got to see a lot of the countryside.
751 We would take these real long walks.
752 ~ There must be some kind of way ~
753 ~ Out of here ~
754 ~ Said the joker to the thief ~
755 And we were always lookin'
756 for this guy named Charlie.
757 ~ There's too much confusion ~
758 ~ I can't get no relief ~
759 Hold it up!
760 Hold up, boys!
761 It wasn't always fun.
762 Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings
763 about a rock or a trail or the road,
764 so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.
765 Get down!
766 Shut up!
767 So we did.
768 Now I don't know much about anything,
769 but I think some of America's best young men
770 served in this war.
771 There was Dallas from Phoenix.
772 Cleveland... he was from Detroit.
773 Hey, Tex.
774 What the hell's going on?
775 And Tex was...
776 Well, I don't remember where Tex come from...
777 Ah, nothing.
778 Fourth platoon, on your feet.
779 Y'all got 10 clicks to go to that river.
780 Move out.
781 1, 2! Hup!
782 Step it up!
783 Look alive out there.
784 The good thing about Vietnam
785 is there was always someplace to go.
786 Fire in the hole!
787 Gump, check out that hole.
788 And there was always something to do.
789 Mount 'em up!
790 Spread out! Cover his back!
791 One day it started raining,
792 and it didn't quit for four months.
793 We've been through every kind of rain there is...
794 little bitty stinging rain
795 and big old fat rain,
796 rain that flew in sideways,
797 and sometimes rain even seemed
798 to come straight up from underneath.
799 Shoot, it even rained at night.
800 Hey, Forrest.
801 Hey, Bubba.
802 I'm going to lean up against you.
803 You lean up against me.
804 This way we don't have to sleep
805 with our heads in the mud.
806 You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?
807 'Cause we be watching out for one another,
808 like brothers and stuff.
809 Hey, Forrest,
810 something I been thinking about.
811 I got a very important question to ask you.
812 How would you like to go
813 into the shrimping business with me?
814 O.K.
815 Man, I tell you what.
816 I got it all figured out, too.
817 So many pounds of shrimp
818 will pay off the boat.
819 So many pounds for gas.
820 We'll live right on the boat.
821 We ain't got to pay no rent.
822 We can just work it together,
823 split everything right down the middle.
824 Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.
825 Hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.
826 That's a fine idea.
827 Bubba did have a fine idea.
828 I even wrote Jenny
829 and told her all about it.
830 I sent her letters...
831 Not every day, but almost.
832 I told her what I was doing
833 and asked her what she was doing
834 and told her how I thought about her always.
835 And how I was looking forward
836 to getting a letter from her
837 just as soon as she had the time.
838 I'd always let her know that I was O.K.
839 Then I'd sign each letter "Love, Forrest Gump."
840 ~ There's somethin' happenin' here ~
841 This one day, we was out walking like always,
842 and then, just like that,
843 somebody turned off the rain,
844 and the sun come out.
845 ~ I got to beware ~
846 Ambush!
847 Take cover!
848 Get that pig up here, god damn it!
849 Forrest! You okay?
850 Strong-arm, Strong-arm!
851 Hey! We got a man down!
852 Strong-arm, this is Leg Lima 6! Over!
853 Roger, Strong-arm! Be advised we have incoming
854 from the treeline at point blue
855 plus two! A.K.S and rockets!
856 We're getting it hard!
857 Misfire! Misfire!
858 God damn it!
859 Get that pig unfucked and on the treeline!
860 They got us, and it hurt.
861 We're going to move back to the blue line.
862 Pull back! Pull back!
863 Forrest! Run, Forrest!
864 Pull back!
865 Run! Run, man!
866 Run!
867 Pull back, Gump!
868 Run, God damn it! Run!
869 I ran and ran just like Jenny told me to.
870 I ran so far so fast
871 that pretty soon I was all by myself,
872 which was a bad thing.
873 Bubba.
874 Bubba was my best good friend.
875 I had to make sure he was O.K.
876 Where the hell are you?
877 Bubba!
878 And on my way back to find Bubba,
879 well, there was this boy laying on the ground.
880 Tex.
881 O.K.
882 I couldn't let him lay there all alone,
883 scared the way he was,
884 so I grabbed him up
885 and run him out of there.
886 Every time I went back looking for Bubba,
887 somebody else was saying,
888 "Help me, Forrest, help me!"
889 O.K. Here. Here.
890 No sweat, man. Lay back. You'll be O.K.
891 I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.
892 I know my position
893 is danger close!
894 We got Charlie all over this area.
895 I got to have those fast movers in here now. Over.
896 Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!
897 I know he's dead!
898 My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!
899 God damn it!
900 What are you doing?
901 You leave me here!
902 Get away. Just leave me here!
903 Get out!
904 Aah! God, I said leave me here, God damn it!
905 Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.
906 Be advised your fast movers are inbound. Over.
907 Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.
908 Aah! Something bit me!
909 Aah! Aah!
910 You son of a bitch!
911 Aah!
912 I can't leave the platoon.
913 I told you to leave me there, Gump.
914 Forget about me. Get yourself out!
915 Did you hear what I said?
916 Gump, damn it, put me down.
917 Get your ass out of here.
918 I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, God damn you!
919 Where the hell do you think you're going?
920 To get Bubba.
921 I got an air strike inbound right now.
922 They're going to nape the whole area.
923 Stay here! That's an order.
924 I gotta find Bubba!
925 Forrest.
926 Bubba.
927 I'm O.K., Forrest.
928 I'm O.K.
929 O-Oh, Bubba, no.
930 I'll be all right.
931 Come on.
932 Come on. Come on.
933 Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.
934 I'm O.K. I'm fine.
935 Top smoke. Get it up there.
936 If I'd have known this was going to be
937 the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,
938 I'd of thought of something better to say.
939 Hey, Bubba.
940 Hey, Forrest.
941 Forrest...
942 Why did this happen?
943 You got shot.
944 Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.
945 I want to go home.
946 Bubba was my best good friend.
947 And even I know
948 that ain't something you can find just around the corner.
949 Bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain,
950 but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.
951 That's all I have to say about that.
952 It was a bullet, wasn't it?
953 A bullet?
954 That jumped up and bit you.
955 Oh. Yes, sir.
956 Bit me directly in the but-tocks.
957 They said it was a million dollar wound, but...
958 The army must keep that money,
959 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.
960 The only good thing about being wounded in the but-tocks
961 is the ice cream.
962 They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.
963 And guess what?
964 A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.
965 Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.
966 Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!
967 It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.
968 Harper!
969 Cooper.
970 Larson.
971 Webster.
972 Gump.
973 Gump!
974 I'm Forrest Gump.
975 Kyle.
976 Nichols.
977 McMill.
978 Johnson.
979 Surprise, surprise, surprise!
980 Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?
981 Turn it off.
982 You are tuned to the American forces
983 Vietnam network.
984 This is channel 6, Saigon.
985 Good catch, Gump.
986 You know how to play this?
987 Come on. Let me show you.
988 Now, the secret to this game is
989 no matter what happens,
990 never, ever...
991 Take your eye off the ball.
992 All right.
993 For some reason,
994 Ping-Pong came very natural to me.
995 See?
996 Any idiot can play.
997 So I started playing it all the time.
998 I played Ping-Pong
999 even when I didn't have anyone to play Ping-Pong with.
1000 The hospital's people
1001 said it made me look like a duck in water...
1002 Whatever that means.
1003 Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.
1004 I played Ping-Pong so much,
1005 I even played it in my sleep.
1006 Now...
1007 You listen to me.
1008 We all have a destiny.
1009 Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!
1010 I should have died out there with my men,
1011 but now... I'm nothing but a goddamn cripple,
1012 a legless freak!
1013 Look. Look! Look at me!
1014 You see that?
1015 Do you know what it's like
1016 not to be able to use your legs?
1017 Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.
1018 Did you hear what I said?
1019 You cheated me!
1020 I had a destiny.
1021 I was supposed to die in the field
1022 with honor!
1023 That was my destiny,
1024 and you... cheated me out of it!
1025 You understand what I'm saying, Gump?
1026 This wasn't supposed to happen...
1027 Not to me.
1028 I had a destiny.
1029 I was...
1030 Lieutenant...
1031 Dan Taylor.
1032 Y-You still
1033 Lieutenant Dan.
1034 Look at me.
1035 What am I going to do now?
1036 What am I going to do now?
1037 PFC Gump?
1038 Yes, sir!
1039 As you were.
1040 Son,
1041 you been awarded the Medal of Honor.
1042 Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?
1043 They want to give me a med...
1044 Ma'am.
1045 What did they do with Lieutenant Dan?
1046 They sent him home.
1047 Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.
1048 The ceremony was kicked off
1049 with a candid speech by the president
1050 regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam.
1051 Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to men from each of the armed services.
1052 America owes you a debt of gratitude, son.
1053 I understand you were wounded.
1054 Where were you hit?
1055 In the but-tocks, sir.
1056 Well, that must be a sight.
1057 I'd kinda like to see that.
1058 ~ And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson ~
1059 ~ Jesus loves you more than you will know ~
1060 ~ Whoa, whoa, whoa ~
1061 ~ God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson ~
1062 God damn, son!
1063 After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down,
1064 so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.
1065 Hilary! I got the vets.
1066 What do you want to do with them?
1067 It's a good thing Mama was resting,
1068 'cause the streets was awful crowded with people
1069 lookin'at all the statues and monuments,
1070 and some of them people were loud and pushy.
1071 O.K., follow me!
1072 Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line.
1073 Come on.
1074 Go!
1075 Hey, you're a good man for doing this.
1076 Good.
1077 O.K.
1078 There was this man giving a little talk.
1079 And for some reason,
1080 he was wearing an American flag for a shirt.
1081 And he liked to say the "F" word... a lot.
1082 "F" this and "F" that.
1083 And every time he said the "F" word,
1084 people, for some reason, well, they cheered.
1085 Yeah! Yeah!
1086 Come on, man. Come up here, man.
1087 Come on. Come on.
1088 Yeah, you! Come on. Move, move!
1089 Go on. Let's get up there.
1090 Tell us a little bit about the war, man.
1091 The war in Vietnam?
1092 The war in Viet...
1093 Fucking-nam!
1094 Well...
1095 There was only one thing I could say
1096 about the war in Vietnam.
1097 There's only one thing I can say about...
1098 The war in Vietnam.
1099 In Vietnam...
1100 What the hell are you do...
1101 I'll beat your head in, you goddamn oinker!
1102 Jesus Christ! What did they do with this?
1103 Can't hear you!
1104 Can't hear anything!
1105 This... This one!
1106 Give me that!
1107 Speak up!
1108 That's it.
1109 And that's all I have to say
1110 about that.
1111 That's so right on, man.
1112 You said it all.
1113 What's your name, man?
1114 My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.
1115 Forrest Gump.
1116 - Gump! Gump! - Gump!
1117 Forrest!
1118 Forrest!
1119 Jenny!
1120 Forrest!
1121 Hey!
1122 It was the happiest moment of my life.
1123 Jenny and me were just like peas and carrots again.
1124 She showed me around
1125 and even introduced me to some of her new friends.
1126 Shut that blind, man!
1127 And get your white ass away from that window.
1128 Don't you know we in a war here?
1129 He's cool. He's one of us.
1130 Let me tell you about us.
1131 Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders
1132 from the racial onslaught of the pig
1133 who wishes to brutalize our black leaders,
1134 rape our women, and destroy our black communities.
1135 Who's the baby killer?
1136 This is my good friend I told you about.
1137 This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley.
1138 Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,
1139 and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.
1140 We are here to offer protection and help
1141 for all those who need our help,
1142 because we, the Black Panthers,
1143 are against the war in Vietnam.
1144 We are against any war
1145 where black soldiers are sent to the front line
1146 to die for a country that hates them.
1147 We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight
1148 and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities.
1149 We are against these racist and imperial acts...
1150 ~ And I gave her the gun ~
1151 ~ I shot her ~
1152 Forrest!
1153 Stop it!
1154 Forrest!
1155 Stop it! Stop it!
1156 I shouldn't have brought you here.
1157 I should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle!
1158 He should not be hitting you, Jenny.
1159 Come on, Forrest.
1160 Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
1161 He doesn't mean it when he does things like this.
1162 I would never hurt you, Jenny.
1163 I know you wouldn't, Forrest.
1164 I wanted to be your boyfriend.
1165 That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
1166 You look handsome in it.
1167 You do.
1168 You know what?
1169 What?
1170 I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.
1171 Me, too, Forrest.
1172 We walked around all night, Jenny and me,
1173 just talkin'.
1174 She told me about all the traveling she'd done
1175 and how she discovered ways to expand her mind
1176 and learn how to live in harmony...
1177 which must be out west somewhere,
1178 'cause she made it all the way to California.
1179 ~ Love one another right now ~
1180 Hey.
1181 Anybody want to go to San Francisco?
1182 I'll go.
1183 Far out!
1184 It was a very special night
1185 for the two of us.
1186 I didn't want it to end.
1187 Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
1188 I have to, Forrest.
1189 Jenny?
1190 Things got a little out of hand.
1191 It's just this war
1192 and that lying son of a bitch Johnson and...
1193 I would never hurt you. You know that.
1194 Know what I think?
1195 I think...
1196 You should go home to Greenbow,
1197 Alabama!
1198 Forrest,
1199 we have very different lives, you know.
1200 I want you...
1201 To have this.
1202 Forrest, I can't keep this.
1203 I got it...
1204 Just by doing what you told me to do.
1205 Why are you so good to me?
1206 You're my girl.
1207 I'll always be your girl.
1208 ~ To everything, turn, turn, turn ~
1209 ~ There is a season, turn, turn, turn ~
1210 ~ And a time to every purpose ~
1211 ~ Under heaven ~
1212 And just like that,
1213 she was gone out of my life again.
1214 That's one small step for man,
1215 one giant leap for mankind.
1216 I thought I was going back to Vietnam,
1217 but instead they decided
1218 the best way for me to fight the Communists
1219 was to play Ping-Pong,
1220 so I was in the Special Services,
1221 traveling around the country,
1222 cheering up wounded veterans and showing 'em
1223 how to play Ping-Pong.
1224 I was so good that some years later,
1225 the army decided I should be
1226 on the all-American Ping-Pong team.
1227 We were the first Americans to visit the land of China
1228 in a million years or something.
1229 Somebody said world peace was in our hands,
1230 but all I did was play Ping-Pong.
1231 When I got home, I was a national celebrity,
1232 famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.
1233 Here he is, Forrest Gump.
1234 Right here.
1235 Gump, have a seat.
1236 Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
1237 Welcome home.
1238 Can you tell us, um,
1239 what was China like?
1240 In the land of China...
1241 people hardly got nothin'at all.
1242 No possessions?
1243 And in China, they never go to church.
1244 No religion, too?
1245 Oh.
1246 Hard to imagine.
1247 Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.
1248 Some years later,
1249 that nice young man from England
1250 was on his way home to see his little boy
1251 and was signing some autographs.
1252 For no particular reason at all,
1253 somebody shot him.
1254 They gave you...
1255 The congressional Medal of Honor.
1256 Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.
1257 Lieutenant Dan!
1258 They gave you...
1259 The congressional Medal of Honor.
1260 Yes, sir. They surely did.
1261 They gave you,
1262 an imbecile,
1263 a moron who goes on television
1264 and makes a fool out of himself
1265 in front of the whole damn country,
1266 the Congressional Medal of Honor.
1267 Yes, sir.
1268 Well... that... that's just perfect!
1269 Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that...
1270 Goddamn bless America.
1271 Hey, hey!
1272 Whoa...
1273 Oh, God, whoa!
1274 Ow! Oh! Oh, God!
1275 Lieutenant Dan!
1276 Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel
1277 and because he didn't have no legs,
1278 he spent most of his time exercising his arms.
1279 Make a right. Take a right!
1280 Hey!
1281 Ah, ah!
1282 What do you do here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?
1283 I'm living off the government tit.
1284 Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?
1285 I'm walking here!
1286 Ah, get out!
1287 Come on. Go, go, go!
1288 I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
1289 and celebrated the holidays.
1290 You have a great year, and hurry home.
1291 God bless you.
1292 Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?
1293 I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for Him, sir.
1294 That's all these cripples down at the V. A...
1295 That's all they ever talk about.
1296 Jesus this and Jesus that. Ha.
1297 Have I... found Jesus?
1298 They even had a priest come and talk to me.
1299 He said God is listening,
1300 but I have to help myself.
1301 Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,
1302 I'll get to walk beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.
1303 Did you hear what I said?
1304 Walk...
1305 Beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.
1306 Well... kiss my crippled ass.
1307 God is listening?
1308 What a crock of shit.
1309 I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.
1310 Oh?
1311 Well...
1312 Before you go... why don't you
1313 get your ass down to the corner
1314 and get us more Ripple?
1315 Yes, sir.
1316 We're at approximately
1317 45th Street in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
1318 This is the site of the old...
1319 What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?
1320 Shrimping boats.
1321 Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?
1322 I got to buy me one
1323 soon as I have some money.
1324 I promised Bubba in Vietnam
1325 that as soon as the war was over, we'd be partners.
1326 He'd be the captain and I'd be his first mate.
1327 But now that he's dead, I got to be the captain.
1328 A shrimp boat captain.
1329 Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
1330 Now hear this!
1331 Private Gump here
1332 is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.
1333 Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.
1334 The day that you are a shrimp boat captain,
1335 I will come and be your first mate.
1336 Ha ha ha!
1337 If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
1338 that's the day I'm an astronaut!
1339 Danny, what are you complaining about?
1340 Danny, how you doing, huh?
1341 Mr. Hot Wheels!
1342 Who's your friend?
1343 My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.
1344 This is cunning Carla
1345 and long-limbs Lenore.
1346 So where you been, babycakes, huh?
1347 Haven't seen you around lately.
1348 You should have been here for Christmas,
1349 'cause Tommy bought a free round
1350 and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.
1351 Well, well, I had, uh... company.
1352 Hey! Hey, we was just there!
1353 That's like Times Square.
1354 Don't you just love New Year's?
1355 You can start all over.
1356 Everybody gets a second chance.
1357 It's funny...
1358 but in the middle of all that fun,
1359 I began to think about Jenny,
1360 wondering how she was spending her New Year's night
1361 out in California.
1362 ~ Don't you love her ways? ~
1363 ~ Tell me what you say ~
1364 ~ Don't you love her madly? ~
1365 ~ Want to meet her daddy? ~
1366 ~ Don't you love her face? ~
1367 ~ Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door? ~
1368 9... 8...
1369 7... 6...
1370 5... 4...
1371 3... 2...
1372 1!
1373 Happy new year!
1374 ~ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ~
1375 ~ And never brought to mind ~
1376 Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!
1377 ~ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ~
1378 ~ In days of auld lang syne ~
1379 ~ Together we stand ~
1380 ~ Divided we fall ~
1381 ~ Come on now, people, let's ~
1382 ~ Get on the ball ~
1383 ~ And work together ~
1384 ~ Come on, come on ~
1385 ~ Let's work together ~
1386 Oh! What are you, stupid or something?
1387 What's your problem?
1388 What's his problem?
1389 Did you lose your packet in the war or something?
1390 Is your friend stupid or something?
1391 What did you say?
1392 I said is your friend stupid or something?
1393 Don't call him stupid!
1394 Hey, don't push her!
1395 You shut up!
1396 Don't you ever call him stupid!
1397 Come on, baby, why you being so upset, huh?
1398 Get your goddamned clothes
1399 and get the hell out of here!
1400 You should be in a sideshow.
1401 You're so pathetic!
1402 Get out of here!
1403 You big guy!
1404 Loser. You freak!
1405 Oh, no. No.
1406 I'm sorry I ruined
1407 your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.
1408 She tastes like cigarettes.
1409 I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
1410 there's some things you just can't change.
1411 He didn't want to be called crippled
1412 just like I didn't want to be called stupid.
1413 Happy new year, Gump.
1414 The U.S. Ping-Pong team
1415 met with President Nixon today...
1416 Wouldn't you know it?
1417 A few months later,
1418 they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
1419 to visit the White House.
1420 So I went...
1421 Again.
1422 And I met the president of the United States again.
1423 Only this time, they didn't get us rooms
1424 in a real fancy hotel.
1425 Are you enjoying yourself
1426 in our nation's capital, young man?
1427 Where are you staying?
1428 It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
1429 Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel.
1430 It's brand-new. Very modern.
1431 I'll have my people take care of it.
1432 Security.
1433 Yeah. Sir,
1434 you might want to send a maintenance man
1435 over to that office across the way.
1436 The lights are off
1437 and they must be looking for a fuse box,
1438 'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake.
1439 O.K., sir. I'll check it out.
1440 Thank you. Good night.
1441 Therefore...
1442 I shall resign the presidency
1443 effective at noon tomorrow.
1444 Vice President Ford
1445 will be sworn in as president
1446 at that hour in this office.
1447 Forrest Gump.
1448 Yes, sir!
1449 As you were.
1450 I have your discharge papers.
1451 Service is up, son.
1452 Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?
1453 For the army, it does.
1454 And just like that,
1455 my service in the United States Army was over.
1456 So I went home.
1457 I'm home, Mama.
1458 I know. I know.
1459 Louise, he's here.
1460 Now, when I got home, I had no idea,
1461 but Mama had all sorts of visitors.
1462 We've had all sorts of visitors.
1463 Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.
1464 One man even left a check for $25,000
1465 if you'd be agreeable to saying you like using their paddle.
1466 I only like using my own paddle.
1467 Hi, Miss Louise.
1468 Hey, Forrest.
1469 I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.
1470 I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,
1471 see if it grows on you.
1472 That Mama, she sure was right.
1473 It's funny how things work out.
1474 I didn't stay home for long
1475 because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
1476 and I always try to keep my promise,
1477 so I went on down to Bayou La Batre
1478 to meet Bubba's family.
1479 Are you crazy or just plain stupid?
1480 Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.
1481 I guess.
1482 And, of course,
1483 I paid my respect to Bubba himself.
1484 Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.
1485 I remember everything you said,
1486 and I got it all figured out.
1487 I'm taking $24,562.47
1488 that I got, that's left
1489 after a new haircut and a new suit
1490 and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,
1491 and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.
1492 Tell me something.
1493 Are you stupid or something?
1494 Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
1495 That's what's left after me saying,
1496 "When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,
1497 "I just loved playing Ping-Pong
1498 with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"
1499 which everybody knows isn't true,
1500 but Mama said it was just a little white lie,
1501 so it wasn't hurting nobody.
1502 So anyway, I'm putting all that
1503 on gas, ropes, and new nets
1504 and a brand-new shrimping boat.
1505 Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,
1506 but you know what I found out?
1507 Shrimping is tough.
1508 I only caught five.
1509 A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.
1510 Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?
1511 It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.
1512 I'd never named a boat before,
1513 but there was only one I could think of,
1514 the most beautiful name in the wide world.
1515 ~ Do a little dance ~
1516 ~ Make a little love ~
1517 ~ Get down tonight ~
1518 ~ Do a little dance ~
1519 ~ Make a little love ~
1520 ~ Get down tonight ~
1521 ~ Whoo ~
1522 ~ Get down tonight... ~
1523 Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
1524 in a long while,
1525 but I thought about her a lot.
1526 I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.
1527 ~ Oh, and the bird you cannot change ~
1528 ~ And this bird you cannot change ~
1529 ~ Lord knows I can't change ~
1530 ~ Lord, help me, I can't change ~
1531 I thought about Jenny all the time.
1532 Hey!
1533 Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?
1534 Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.
1535 Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.
1536 Yes, I know that.
1537 You wrote me a letter, you idiot.
1538 Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
1539 I had to see this for myself...
1540 And...
1541 I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,
1542 that I'd be your first mate.
1543 Well, here I am.
1544 I'm a man of my word.
1545 O.K.
1546 But don't you be thinking
1547 that I'm going to be calling you "sir."
1548 No, sir.
1549 It's my boat.
1550 I have a feeling if we head due east,
1551 we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.
1552 Take a left!
1553 Which way?
1554 Over there!
1555 They're over there!
1556 Get on the wheel and take a left.
1557 O.K.
1558 Gump, what are you doing?
1559 Take a left!
1560 Left!
1561 That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!
1562 Ha ha!
1563 That's where we'll find them.
1564 Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
1565 O.K., so I was wrong.
1566 Well, how are we going to find them?
1567 Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.
1568 ~ So pray that ~
1569 ~ I'm homeward bound... ~
1570 So I went to church every Sunday.
1571 Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,
1572 though I think he left the praying up to me.
1573 No shrimp.
1574 Where the hell's this God of yours?
1575 It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that
1576 'cause right then God showed up.
1577 You'll never sink this boat!
1578 Now, me, I was scared,
1579 but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.
1580 Come on!
1581 You call this a storm?
1582 Come on, you son of a bitch!
1583 It's time for a showdown!
1584 You and me!
1585 I'm right here! Come and get me!
1586 Ha ha! Ha ha!
1587 You'll never sink...
1588 This...
1589 Boat!
1590 Ha ha ha ha!
1591 Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,
1592 destroying nearly everything in its path.
1593 And as in other towns up and down the coast,
1594 Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry
1595 has fallen victim to Carmen
1596 and has been left in utter ruin.
1597 This reporter has learned,
1598 in fact, only one shrimping boat
1599 actually survived the storm.
1600 Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.
1601 After that, shrimping was easy.
1602 ~ There will be great bounty ~
1603 ~ Oh, my God... ~
1604 Since people still needed them shrimps
1605 for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all
1606 and we were the only boat left standing,
1607 Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got.
1608 We got a whole bunch of boats.
1609 12 Jennys, big old warehouse.
1610 We even have hats
1611 that say "Bubba Gump" on them.
1612 Bubba Gump Shrimp.
1613 It's a household name.
1614 Hold on there, boy.
1615 Are you telling me you're the owner
1616 of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?
1617 Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.
1618 Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
1619 but that tops them all.
1620 Ha ha ha ha!
1621 We were sitting next to a millionaire.
1622 Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,
1623 and you tell it so well,
1624 with such enthusiasm.
1625 Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
1626 Yes, I would.
1627 That's him right there.
1628 Let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.
1629 Forrest...
1630 I never thanked you for saving my life.
1631 He never actually said so,
1632 but I think he made his peace with God.
1633 For the second time in 17 days,
1634 President Ford escaped possible assassination today.
1635 Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.
1636 Jenny 1. Go, Margo.
1637 Forrest has a phone call.
1638 Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.
1639 He is indisposed at the moment.
1640 His mama's sick.
1641 Where's Mama?
1642 She's upstairs.
1643 Hi, Forrest.
1644 I'll see you tomorrow.
1645 Oh, all right.
1646 Sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?
1647 What's the matter, Mama?
1648 I'm dying, Forrest.
1649 Come on in, sit down over here.
1650 Why are you dying, Mama?
1651 It's my time.
1652 It's just my time.
1653 Oh, now...
1654 Don't you be afraid, sweetheart.
1655 Death is just a part of life.
1656 Something we're all destined to do.
1657 I didn't know it,
1658 but I was destined to be your mama.
1659 I did the best I could.
1660 You did good.
1661 Well... I happen to believe you make your own destiny.
1662 You have to do the best with what God gave you.
1663 What's my destiny, Mama?
1664 You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.
1665 Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.
1666 You never know what you're going to get.
1667 Mama always had a way of explaining things
1668 so I could understand them.
1669 I will miss you, Forrest.
1670 She had got the cancer
1671 and died on a Tuesday.
1672 I bought her a new hat
1673 with little flowers on it.
1674 And that's all I have to say about that.
1675 Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?
1676 There'll be another one along shortly.
1677 Now, because I had been a football star and war hero
1678 and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain
1679 and a college graduate,
1680 the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,
1681 decided to get together and offered me a fine job.
1682 So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,
1683 though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.
1684 He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.
1685 So then I got a call from him
1686 saying we don't have to worry about money no more,
1687 and I said, "That's good. One less thing."
1688 ~ I've got a new hope... ~
1689 Now Mama said there's only so much fortune
1690 a man really needs,
1691 and the rest is just for showing off.
1692 So I gave a whole bunch of it
1693 to the Foursquare Gospel Church...
1694 and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...
1695 and even though Bubba was dead
1696 and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,
1697 I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.
1698 You know what?
1699 She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
1700 That smells wonderful.
1701 And 'cause I was a gozillionaire
1702 and I liked doing it so much,
1703 I cut that grass for free.
1704 But at nighttime when there was nothing to do
1705 and the house was all empty,
1706 I'd always think of Jenny.
1707 And then... she was there.
1708 Hello, Forrest.
1709 Hello, Jenny.
1710 Jenny came back and stayed with me.
1711 Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go,
1712 or maybe it was because she was so tired
1713 'cause she went to bed and slept and slept
1714 like she hadn't slept in years.
1715 It was wonderful having her home.
1716 Every day we'd take a walk,
1717 and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,
1718 and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging and shrimping
1719 and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
1720 I did all the talking.
1721 Jenny most of the time was real quiet.
1722 How could you do this?
1723 Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
1724 I never really knew why she came back,
1725 but I didn't care.
1726 It was like olden times.
1727 We was like peas and carrots again.
1728 Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
1729 and put them in her room for her,
1730 and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get
1731 in the wide world.
1732 They're made just for running.
1733 ~ Carry me home to see my kin ~
1734 And she even showed me how to dance.
1735 ~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~
1736 ~ And I think it's a sin ~
1737 ~ Sweet home Alabama... ~
1738 Well, we was like family, Jenny and me...
1739 and it was the happiest time in my life.
1740 You done watching it?
1741 Mm-hmm.
1742 I'm going to bed.
1743 Will you marry me?
1744 I'd make a good husband, Jenny.
1745 You would, Forrest.
1746 But you won't marry me.
1747 You don't want to marry me.
1748 Why don't you love me, Jenny?
1749 I'm not a smart man,
1750 but I know what love is.
1751 Jenny...
1752 Forrest, I do love you.
1753 Where are you running off to?
1754 I'm not running.
1755 That day,
1756 for no particular reason,
1757 I decided to go for a little run.
1758 So I ran to the end of the road,
1759 and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.
1760 President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...
1761 And when I got there,
1762 I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.
1763 Now, I figured since I'd run this far,
1764 maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.
1765 And that's what I did.
1766 I ran clear across Alabama.
1767 No particular reason. I just kept on going.
1768 I ran clear to the ocean.
1769 And when I got there,
1770 I figured since I'd gone this far,
1771 might as well turn around, just keep on going.
1772 And when I got to another ocean,
1773 I figured since I'd gone this far...
1774 I might as well just turn back
1775 and keep right on going.
1776 When I got tired, I slept.
1777 When I got hungry, I ate.
1778 When I had to go...
1779 You know...
1780 I went.
1781 And so...
1782 You just ran.
1783 Yeah.
1784 ~ Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels ~
1785 ~ Lookin' back at the years gone by ~
1786 ~ Like so many summer fields ~
1787 ~ In '65, I was 17 ~
1788 ~ And runnin' up one on one ~
1789 ~ I don't know where I'm runnin' now ~
1790 ~ I'm just runnin' on ~
1791 ~ Runnin' on ~
1792 ~ Runnin' on empty ~
1793 ~ Runnin' on ~
1794 ~ Runnin' dry ~
1795 ~ Runnin' on... ~
1796 I'd think a lot...
1797 about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.
1798 But most of all,
1799 I thought about Jenny.
1800 I thought about her a lot.
1801 For more than two years,
1802 a man named Forrest Gump,
1803 a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep,
1804 has been running across America.
1805 Charles Cooper brings you this report.
1806 For the fourth time
1807 on his journey across America,
1808 Forrest Gump, the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
1809 is about to cross the Mississippi River again today.
1810 I'll be damned. Forrest?
1811 Sir, where are you running?
1812 Are you doing this for world peace?
1813 Are you doing this for the homeless?
1814 Are you running for women's rights?
1815 The environment?
1816 They just couldn't believe
1817 that somebody would do all that running
1818 for no particular reason.
1819 Why are you doing this?
1820 I just felt like running.
1821 I just felt like runnin'.
1822 That's you.
1823 I can't believe it's really you.
1824 Now... for some reason,
1825 what I was doing seemed to...
1826 Make sense to people.
1827 It was like an alarm went off in my head.
1828 I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.
1829 Here's somebody who has the answer."
1830 I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.
1831 So I got company.
1832 And after that, I got more company.
1833 And then, even more people joined in.
1834 Somebody later told me
1835 it gave people hope.
1836 Now...
1837 Now, I don't know anything about that,
1838 but some of those people asked me
1839 if I could help them out.
1840 I was wondering if you might help me.
1841 I'm in the bumper sticker business.
1842 I need a good slogan,
1843 and since you've been so inspirational,
1844 I thought you might be able to help me...
1845 Whoa, man! You just ran
1846 through a big pile of dog shit!
1847 It happens.
1848 What, shit?
1849 Sometimes.
1850 And some years later, I heard that that fella
1851 did come up with a bumper sticker slogan
1852 and made a lot of money off of it.
1853 Another time, I was running along.
1854 Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,
1855 he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,
1856 but he couldn't draw that well,
1857 and he didn't have a camera.
1858 Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.
1859 Have a nice day.
1860 Some years later, I found out
1861 that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.
1862 He made a lot of money.
1863 Anyway, like I was saying,
1864 I had a lot of company.
1865 My mama always said,
1866 "You got to put the past behind you
1867 before you can move on. "
1868 And I think that's what my running was all about.
1869 I had run for three years...
1870 two months...
1871 14 days, and 16 hours.
1872 Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something.
1873 I'm pretty tired.
1874 Think I'll go home now.
1875 Now what are we supposed to do?
1876 And just like that...
1877 my runnin'days was over.
1878 So I went home to Alabama.
1879 Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,
1880 as President Reagan was leaving the...
1881 Five or six gunshots were fired
1882 by an unknown, would-be assassin.
1883 The president was shot in the chest...
1884 I picked up the mail.
1885 And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
1886 I got a letter from Jenny
1887 wondering if I could come down to Savannah
1888 and see her, and that's what I'm doing here.
1889 Uh-huh.
1890 She saw me on TV... running.
1891 I'm supposed to go on the number 9 bus to Richmond Street
1892 and get off and go one block left
1893 to 1947 Henry Street...
1894 Apartment 4.
1895 Why, you don't need to take a bus.
1896 Henry Street is just five or six blocks...
1897 Down that way.
1898 Down that way?
1899 Down that way.
1900 It was nice talking to you.
1901 I hope everything works out for you!
1902 Hey!
1903 Forrest!
1904 How you doin'?
1905 Come in! Come in!
1906 I got your letter.
1907 Oh, I was wondering about that.
1908 This your house?
1909 Yeah. It's messy right now.
1910 I just got off work.
1911 It's nice.
1912 You got air-conditioning.
1913 Uh...
1914 Thank you.
1915 I ate some.
1916 I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook of... of your clippings and...
1917 Everything. There you are.
1918 Yes, I got you running.
1919 I ran a long way.
1920 It's a long time.
1921 There...
1922 Listen, Forrest, I don't know how to say this.
1923 Um...
1924 I just...
1925 I want to apologize
1926 for anything that I ever did to you 'cause...
1927 I was messed up...
1928 For a long time, and...
1929 Yoo-hoo!
1930 Hey!
1931 Hi.
1932 Hey, you.
1933 This is my old friend from Alabama.
1934 How do you do?
1935 Next week my schedule changes, so I can...
1936 No problem. Got to go. I'm double-parked.
1937 O.K. Thanks.
1938 This is my very good friend Mr. Gump.
1939 Can you say hi?
1940 Hello, Mr. Gump.
1941 Hello.
1942 Can I go watch TV now?
1943 Yes. Just keep it low.
1944 You're a mama, Jenny.
1945 I'm a mama.
1946 His name's Forrest.
1947 Like me!
1948 I named him after his daddy.
1949 He got a daddy named Forrest, too?
1950 You're his daddy, Forrest.
1951 Hey...
1952 Forrest, look at me.
1953 Look at me, Forrest.
1954 There's nothing you need to do.
1955 You didn't do anything wrong.
1956 O.K.?
1957 Isn't he beautiful?
1958 He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
1959 But...
1960 Is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...
1961 He's very smart.
1962 He's one of the smartest in his class.
1963 Yeah, it's O.K. Go talk to him.
1964 What are you watching?
1965 Bert and Ernie.
1966 Forrest...
1967 I'm sick.
1968 What, do you have a cough due to a cold?
1969 I have some kind of virus, and the doctors,
1970 they don't know what it is,
1971 and there isn't anything they can do about it.
1972 You could come home with me.
1973 Jenny, you and...
1974 Little Forrest
1975 could come stay
1976 at my house in Greenbow.
1977 I'll take care of you if you're sick.
1978 Would you marry me, Forrest?
1979 O.K.
1980 Please take your seats.
1981 Forrest?
1982 It's time to start.
1983 Hi.
1984 Your tie.
1985 Lieutenant Dan.
1986 Lieutenant Dan.
1987 Hello, Forrest.
1988 You got new legs.
1989 New legs!
1990 Yeah. I got new legs.
1991 Custom-made.
1992 Titanium alloy.
1993 It's what they use on the space shuttle.
1994 Magic legs.
1995 This...
1996 Is my fiancée.
1997 Susan.
1998 Lieutenant Dan.
1999 Hi, Forrest.
2000 Lieutenant Dan...
2001 This is my Jenny.
2002 Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.
2003 Do you, Forrest, take Jenny
2004 to be your wife?
2005 Do you, Jenny, take Forrest
2006 to be your husband?
2007 And so I pronounce you man and wife.
2008 Hi.
2009 Hey, Forrest...
2010 Were you scared in Vietnam?
2011 Yes.
2012 Well, l...
2013 I don't know.
2014 Sometimes it would stop raining
2015 long enough for the stars to come out...
2016 and then it was nice.
2017 It was like just before the sun goes to bed
2018 down on the bayou.
2019 There was always a million sparkles on the water...
2020 like that mountain lake.
2021 It was so clear, Jenny,
2022 it looked like there were two skies
2023 one on top of the other.
2024 And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...
2025 I couldn't tell
2026 where heaven stopped and the earth began.
2027 It's so beautiful.
2028 I wish I could've been there with you.
2029 You were.
2030 I love you.
2031 You died on a Saturday morning.
2032 And I had you placed here under our tree.
2033 And I had that house of your father's
2034 bulldozed to the ground.
2035 Mama...
2036 always said
2037 that dyin' was a part of life.
2038 I sure wish it wasn't.
2039 Little Forrest is...
2040 Doing just fine.
2041 "But..."
2042 About to start school again soon,
2043 and...
2044 and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner
2045 every day.
2046 I make sure he...
2047 Combs his hair
2048 and brushes his teeth every day.
2049 Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.
2050 He's really good.
2051 Uh, Forrest, you go.
2052 Uhh!
2053 We fish a lot.
2054 And every night, we read a book.
2055 He's so smart, Jenny.
2056 You'd be so proud of him.
2057 I am.
2058 He, uh, wrote you a... a letter.
2059 And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,
2060 so I'll just leave it here for you.
2061 Jenny...
2062 I don't know if Mama was right
2063 or if it... it's Lieutenant Dan.
2064 I don't know...
2065 If we each have a...
2066 Destiny...
2067 Or if we're all just floating around accidental-like
2068 on a breeze...
2069 But l... I think...
2070 Maybe it's both.
2071 Maybe both get happening at the same time.
2072 But I miss you, Jenny.
2073 If there's anything you need...
2074 I won't be far away.
2075 Here's your bus.
2076 O.K.
2077 Hey...
2078 I know this.
2079 I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell
2080 because Grandma used to read it to you.
2081 My favorite book.
2082 Here we are.
2083 Hey...
2084 Here you go.
2085 Hey, Forrest...
2086 Don't...
2087 I want to tell you I love you.
2088 I love you, too, Daddy.
2089 I'll be right here when you get back.
2090 You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?
2091 Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
